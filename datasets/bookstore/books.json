Then, almost imperceptibly at first, everything starts to unravel. He losing control of his life.When his best friend joins a Civil War reenactment group, spending his weekends in camps where the year is forever 1863, Roy finds the idea laughable . . . even though he is the descendent and namesake of a Confederate Civil War hero. But when he visits the regiment just to be polite, something unexpected happens, gradually opening Roy's eyes to the secret of a distant conflict that never ended--and leading him down a path that grows more menacing at every turn.With his job disappearing in a way he could never have foreseen, his whole life slipping out of control, Roy falls deeper and deeper into the Rebel past. A strange and powerful idea takes hold: that his life went wrong long before he was born, in the fateful campaigns that preceded the burning of Atlanta. Among the men, a hard-core splinter group is formed--with Roy at its center. On an ancient battlefield, the once-clear lines between reenactment and reality begin to disappear. When his son is taken hostage is it real? When the old muskets fire will they still fire blanks? Or will a bloody history come stunningly to life?An extraordinary novel about the fate of men and women no longer in step with the rhythms of the modern world, marching back into Southern history to make things right, Last of the Dixie Heroes is Peter Abrahams's most dazzlingly original work yet.From the Hardcover edition.","price":35.57,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2009-10-17T18:36:50.013545","updatedAt":"2022-01-13T15:09:15.489114"}

Throughout history, great leaders have fallen, the outcomes of mighty battles have been determined, and the tides of earth-shattering events have been turned by a powerful, inscrutable force of nature: the weather. In Blame It on the Rain, author Laura Lee explores the amazing and sometimes bizarre ways in which weather has influenced our history and helped to bring about sweeping cultural change. She also delights us with a plethora of fascinating weather-related facts (Did you know that more Britons die of sunburn every year than Australians?), while offering readers a hilarious overview of humankind's many absurd attempts to control the elements.  If a weather-produced blight hadn't severely damaged French vineyards, there might never have been a California wine industry. . . . What weather phenomenon was responsible for the sound of the Stradivarius? If there had been a late autumn in Russia, Hitler could have won World War II. . . . Did weather play a part in Truman's victory over Dewey?

But there is a reluctance to accept that foreign intervention is always justified in the same circumstances.

Schiele's spectacular life and early death as well as many of his works - especially the provocative nudes and seemingly pathological self portraits - have time and time again raised questions about parallels between life and work of the Austrian artist. But can such a narrow biographical focus really do Egon Schiele's art justice? This volume looks at Schiele in a different way. It discusses his oeuvre as a contribution to turn-of-the-century debates and discourse about cultural issues such as the crisis of the individual, which around 1900 was labelled with the phrase \"the unsaveable I\". For instance, Schiele's preoccupation with the occult can be understood as a direct response to this crisis. Some of the themes and issues which we find in Schiele's art can also be found in the literature of his time, while his nudes respond to contemporary attitudes towards sexuality.0Exhibition: Städtische Galerie, Munich (3.11.2011-4.3.2012).","price":39.03,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2012-05-09T10:32:21.204600","updatedAt":"2022-12-12T13:11:50.552662"}

In a stationary orbit above the equator, the satellites that broadcast our TV signals, route our phone calls, and process our credit card transactions experience no atmospheric drag. Their inert hulls will continue to drift around Earth until the Sun expands into a red giant and engulfs them about 4.5 billion years from now.\r\nThe Last Pictures, co-published by Creative Time Books, is rooted in the premise that these communications satellites will ultimately become the cultural and material ruins of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, far outlasting anything else humans have created. Inspired in part by ancient cave paintings, nuclear waste warning signs, and Carl Sagan's Golden Records of the 1970s, artist/geographer Trevor Paglen has developed a collection of one hundred images that will be etched onto an ultra-archival, golden silicon disc. The disc, commissioned by Creative Time, will then be sent into orbit onboard the Echostar XVI satellite in September 2012, as both a time capsule and a message to the future.\r\nThe selection of 100 images, which are the centerpiece of the book, was influenced by four years of interviews with leading scientists, philosophers, anthropologists, and artists about the contradictions that characterize contemporary civilizations. Consequently, The Last Pictures engages some of the most profound questions of the human experience, provoking discourse about communication, deep time, and the economic, environmental, and social uncertainties that define our historical moment.\r\nCopub: Creative Time Books","price":8.63,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2012-05-16T09:38:37.333209","updatedAt":"2023-04-20T19:41:52.142155"}

A key assumption in the 2011 baseline is that ethanol support policies disappear in 2012. The baseline also assumes that existing biofuel mandates remain in place and are binding. Two of the scenarios are adverse supply shocks, the first being a 10% increase in the price of nitrogen fertilizer in the United States, and the second, a reversion of cropland into forestland. The third scenario examines how lower energy prices would impact world agriculture. The fourth scenario reintroduces biofuel tax credits and duties. Given that the baseline excludes these policies, the fourth scenario is an attempt to understand the impact of these policies under the market conditions that prevail in early 2011. A key to understanding the results of this fourth scenario is that in the absence of tax credits and duties, the mandate drives biofuel use. Therefore, when the tax credits and duties are reintroduced, the impacts are relatively small. In general, the results show that the entire international commodity market system is remarkably robust with respect to policy changes in one country or in one sector. The policy implication is that domestic policy changes implemented by a large agricultural producer like the United States can have fairly significant impacts on the aggregate world commodity markets. A second point that emerges from the results is that the law of unintended consequences is at work in world agriculture. For example, a U.S. nitrogen tax that might presumably be motivated for environmental benefit results in an increase in world greenhouse gas emissions. A similar situation occurs in the afforestation scenario in which crop production shifts from high-yielding land in the United States to low-yielding land and probably native vegetation in the rest of the world, resulting in an unintended increase in global greenhouse gas emissions.","price":71.31,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2012-06-14T02:08:22.704491","updatedAt":"2020-10-17T11:30:52.693296"}

Translated from Serbian. \r\n\r\nPoetic Circles of Dejan Stojanović\r\n\r\nIn a colorful landscape of contemporary Serbian poetry, a careful reader can recognize that one of its branches, with a decidedly reflective experience of the poetic tradition and heritage, corresponds with a Serbian medieval age, opens up for its Byzantine chords and, in the context of contemporary poetry, is closest to Modern Classicism. In the first wave of Serbian post-World War II poetry, this stream was at the very foundation of a revival, which is almost suppressed today.\r\n\r\nIt seems that precisely today, in the atmosphere of almost complete saturation by the practice of ever changing poetic trends, Serbian poetry is returning to its basics. This picture of a slow rebound, a long awaited reorientation on the Serbian poetic scene, is already happening, by all accounts, and is being sensed in the actual literary production. \r\n\r\nReading the book Circling triggers the associations of this kind of a wave, which is not underground anymore, but has transformed itself into an actual poetic phenomenon. Dejan Stojanović, obviously, is not influenced by any contemporary poetic school or fashionable poetic trend, and is not trapped by some sensibility as a “follower.” Stojanović, as a reflective poet of mature thought and discourse, revives the atmosphere of the ancient (antic) times even in the first layers of his poems. It is easy to notice what specifically marks Stojanović in Serbian contemporary poetry: In weaving his poems and building his lines, a poet has returned to the antic form of utterance, to the difficult and slow movement of the poetic matter, to the dignified and solemn tone, and that kind of wisdom which was nourished in ancient times.\r\n\r\nFar from experiments, from challenges of hazards and poetic adventures, Stojanović’s poems exude the dignity of ancient forms. Similar to the techniques of painters, Stojanović condenses his utterances into short, harmonious poems, most often colored with Mediterranean colors, surprisingly successfully. His poems, almost by a rule, are condensed forms made of short utterances. In the second part of the book, poetic palette becomes darker with an introduction of fantastic and hallucinogenic elements and even apocalyptic tones. Nevertheless, the principle of condensation and consistency of form is never questioned. Apocalyptic scenes and images of evil are expressed in huge blocks that give the impression of a work of an architect or a sculptor. Such are the poems “Vision,” The Chess Board,” “Arrival of Darkness,” and “River of Death,” which all appear as compositions. There is a feeling that Stojanović wrote his poems along with visual compositions; to that extent, visual-imaginative effects are impressive.\r\n\r\nSpecific, surprisingly original, outside the collectively nurtured sensibilities and fashionable trends, Stojanović is an extraordinary example of creative individualism in a generation that nourished such individualism the least. For that reason, the book Circling is not only an example of an extraordinary poetic achievement, which represents a strong encouragement to the important branch of Serbian poetry, but is also an announcement of a moral and spiritual project – a project that belongs to the tradition of Serbian poetry and thought in the best sense of the word.\r\n\r\n-Alek Vukadinović\r\nAfterward to the first Serbian edition (1993)\r\n\r\nDejan Stojanovic’s poems are astute and spiritual tangents of a circle that comprises the phenomena hidden beyond the direct naming of the world and things in poetic transposition. With his poems, he seeks the borderlines between the content and its metaphysical expression, pure thought about the world and its essence. Passion and complete and easy flowing devotion to poetry and to the power of words, poetically and semantically, above all, shape his original poetic output. \r\n\r\n-Petar V.

We are currently processing these records and will have them on line as the processing is completed.\r\n\r\nWe do two things with these records:\r\n\r\nOne, we publish these records in County Marriage Records in Books(3,000 to date), on CDs and in various electronic formats. We no longer publish on microfiche but have a fairly complete inventory of our collection up to 1980. To maximize information density, we restrict each marriage to one line of type in each book. Actually each marriage is listed twice in a combined alphabetical listing based on the Surnames and Given names of each party.\r\n\r\nTwo, surname searches of these large computer databases were available to individuals since the late 1960s via the U. S. Postal Service. The surname searches via U.S.P.S. were supplanted with e-mail. Currently, we search our marriage indexes on a state by state basis and provide the results via e-mail. By using the alphabetical listing described above, we are able to search on partial Surnames and partial Given names to limit the number of searches needed to a maximum number of results.\r\n\r\nThe Hunting For Bears marriage data collection as of about 1980, covering 16 states, was bundled with Family Tree Maker(c) and sold in the tens of thousands and was crucial in making an inferior program (FTM(c)) the most popular genealogical software in the world.\r\n\r\nThe same collection combined with other data acquired by questionable means was included in Ancestry's(c) initial data searches, playing a significant role in its rise to the world's premier genealogy data search engine. Not only was HFB's data taken but its business plan was also!\r\n\r\nThat was the 1980 collection, the 2013 collection dwarfs it in comparison. This book is part of that 2013 collection. It is maintained in a data base structure. Each party in the union is included in the alphabetical listing plus the date of the marriage, license or other source document. Using the records in a database format and listing both participants in the alphabetical sort was so unique in 1960 that the U.S. Government granted Hunting For Bears a (c)copyright on the collection in both electronic and print format.\r\n\r\nSeveral things we are considering in the immediate future are; e_books to buy, loan or free downloads, books available through instant publication, and books on-line.\r\n\r\nOh, the name and logo, Russell, as Nicholas was called in his youth, loved puns. The newspaper genealogy column that he began writing in 1951, Hunting Your Forbearers, quickly became Hunting For Bears and the bear and hunter logo was created.","price":58.98,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2013-05-23T20:27:41.121556","updatedAt":"2013-05-23T20:38:18.038315"}

These topics elicit strong feelings and opinions within the modern Christian world. Ironically, early followers of the faith struggled with these very same issues. Examining and understanding the perspectives of early Christianity can provide new insights into the challenges that believers continue to face today. Early Christianity drew its doctrine from a variety of sources -- personal interpretation, Hebrew scriptures, and church council -- yet the core ideology endured, even as the religion transitioned from being the object of persecution to becoming a legal institution in the Roman Empire. This book celebrates the voices that helped create and develop Christianity during that period. Voices of Early Christianity: Documents from the Origins of Christianity is a collection of excerpts from significant documents from early Christian history, organized topically, then listed chronologically within each section. The author compares textual variations among the works of the apostles, as well as key themes over time, and frames the discussion for further critical thinking. Topics include sexuality, marriage, and divorce; food issues; women in early Christianity; and politics and Christianity. - Publisher.","price":61.94,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2014-11-20T14:47:28.400597","updatedAt":"2022-12-07T09:10:03.613024"}

Three months ago, everything changed for Darla Kurtz and her family. Darla's father was responsible for a terrible fire at Charm's lumber mill that killed five Amish men. Though her father lost his life, too, the town of Charm hasn't looked at her family the same since. Now her brother's anger at the town is spilling over onto Darla, and she has the bruises to prove it. The accident already cost five lives, but if something doesn't change soon, Darla fears it will cost her -- and her family -- even more. Suddenly, Lukas Kinsinger, the head of his father's lumber mill who is responsible for taking care of his three siblings, feels more overwhelmed than ever. He has also never felt more alone -- especially with the new tension between him and Darla, who was his close friend before the accident changed everything. But when he learns of her troubles at home, Lukas knows he can't simply stand by and watch. Someone has to help her before another tragedy occurs -- and that someone is him.

It's about Buddy Williams, a kind of slow-moving boy with a sometime stammer and some of his friends--all origins--and their Boys Club in Dogtown. The club's about to be closed down when a rat in the drain of the swimming pool bites Buddy. Some adults will be closing down on this one after Mr. Hannibal, head of the Boys Club, says he'd rather his boys smoked pot than cigarettes since it \"\"doesn't crud up your lungs.\"\" Anyway, the Boys Club has a chance, since it will inherit a great deal of money, $639,943,96, once the natural heir--a tomcat Buzzer Atkins--dies. He's in the care of a man called Shriker who seems to have extended his life eternally. Anyway Buddy suspects that Buzzer is not 28 years immortal, takes a picture from the library microfilm of the original, prompts an escape by releasing his replacement, digs up the box with the remains of not-so-old Buzzer Atkins, and is guilty of charges of trespassing and harassment. . . .

They have done so since before recorded history. Flowers are used to celebrate all-important occasions, to express love, and are also the basis of global industries. Americans buy ten million flowers a day and perfumes are a worldwide industry worth $30 billion dollars annually. Yet, we know little about flowers, their origins, bizarre sex lives, or how humans relate and depend upon them.\r\n\r\nStephen Buchmann takes us along on an exploratory journey of the roles flowers play in the production of our foods, spices, medicines, perfumes, while simultaneously bringing joy and health. Flowering plants continue to serve as inspiration in our myths and legends, in the fine and decorative arts, and in literary works of prose and poetry. Flowers seduce us—and animals, too—through their myriad shapes, colors, textures, and scents. And because of our extraordinary appetite for more unusual and beautiful “super flowers,” plant breeders have created such unnatural blooms as blue roses and black petunias to cater to the human world of haute couture fashion. In so doing, the nectar and pollen vital to the bees, butterflies, and bats of the world, are being reduced. Buchmann explains the unfortunate consequences, and explores how to counter them by growing the right flowers. Here, he integrates fascinating stories about the many colorful personalities who populate the world of flowers, and the flowers and pollinators themselves, with a research-based narrative that illuminates just why there is, indeed, a Reason for Flowers.","price":24.26,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2017-08-12T22:39:36.759793","updatedAt":"2021-08-06T03:30:26.826257"}

Der Mann ist das starke, die Frau das schwache Geschlecht – so heißt es seit uralten Zeiten. Gern haben „die Herren der Schöpfung“ die Geschichtsschreibung nach ihren Bedürfnissen und Vorstellungen genutzt; die Leistungen der Frauen wurden ignoriert. Frauen, die Ungewöhnliches leisteten, bekamen die Macht der Männer und ihre Konkurrenzangst zu spüren. Die Welt sähe anders aus, hätte es nicht immer wieder Menschen gegeben, die sich mutig gegen Unterdrückung und Engstirnigkeit wehrten. Ein solcher Mensch war Mary Wollstonecraft, die bei Zeitgenossen als politische Publizistin und radikale und streitbare Feministin gleichermaßen bekannt war.\r\n\r\nIn den mehr als zwei Jahrhunderten nach Mary Wollstonecrafts Veröffentlichung „Die Verteidigung der Rechte der Frau“ wurde die Verfasserin zu einer Ikone des modernen Feminismus. Die Suche nach dem idealen Mann (die der Autorin manche Niederlage bescherte), dem wirklichen Partner der Frau – 200 Jahre vor unserer Genderdiskussion: ein aufwühlender Gedanke. Obwohl sie im 18. Jahrhundert lebte, erinnert Mary Wollstonecraft an eine Frau unserer Zeit. Ihr ganzes Leben lang kämpfte sie um die Anerkennung der Würde der Frau und ihre Befreiung von männlicher Vorherrschaft, gegen eine extrem patriarchalisch orientierte Gesellschaft, die ganz selbstverständlich von der geringeren Intelligenz und dem geringeren Wert der Frau ausging und ihr darum fast jede Bildungsmöglichkeit vorenthielt.\r\n\r\n(Quelle: [Edition AV](http://www.edition-av.de/buecher/wollstonecraft.htm))","price":33.78,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2018-01-05T19:30:35.975424","updatedAt":"2023-05-27T06:54:24.137934"}

She was considered too odd to be a truly romantic figure in the eyes of the town, but the locals knew that Canada's most famous painter had once been in love with her, and that she had never gotten over his untimely death. She kept some paintings he gave her in a six-quart basket she'd leave with the neighbours on her rare trips out of town, and in the summers she'd make the trip from her family cottage, where Thomson used to stay, on foot to the graveyard up the hill, where fans of the artist occasionally left bouquets. There she would clear away the flowers. After all, as far as anyone knew, he wasn't there: she had arranged at his family's request for him to be exhumed and moved to a cemetery near Owen Sound.\n\nAs Roy MacGregor's richly detailed Northern Light reveals, not much is as it seems when it comes to Tom Thomson, the most iconic of Canadian painters. Philandering deadbeat or visionary artist and gentleman, victim of accidental drowning or deliberate murder, the man's myth has grown to obscure the real view - and the answers to the mysteries are finally revealed in these pages.\"--Pub. desc.","price":88.87,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2018-03-28T05:55:37.629696","updatedAt":"2022-12-24T10:29:06.314427"}

He's a stocky guy with an outsized swagger. He's been the intimidating, yet sociable don of his posse of friends--including Abe, Keith, Mike, Kevin, and Freddie Fredericks--but one arid summer the tide begins to shift and the third-ranking Kevin starts to get ambitious and seeks a higher position within this social club. But this is no ordinary tale of gangland betrayal--Greg and his entourage are bull elephants in Etosha National Park, Namibia, where, for the last twenty years, Caitlin O'Connell has been a keen observer of their complicated friendships. In Elephant Don, O'Connell, one of the leading experts on elephant communication and social behavior, takes us inside the little-known world of African male elephants, a world that is steeped in ritual, where bonds are maintained by unexpected tenderness punctuated by violence. Elephant Don tracks Greg and his group of bulls as O'Connell tries to understand the vicissitudes of male friendship, power struggles, and play. A frequently heart-wrenching portrayal of commitment, loyalty, and affection between individuals yearning for companionship, it vividly captures the incredible repertoire of elephant behavior and communication. Greg, O'Connell shows, is sometimes a tyrant and other times a benevolent dictator as he attempts to hold on to his position at the top. Though Elephant Don is Greg's story, it is also the story of O'Connell and the challenges and triumphs of field research in environs more hospitable to lions and snakes than scientists. Readers will be drawn into dramatic tales of an elephant society at once exotic and surprisingly familiar, as O'Connell's decades of close research reveal extraordinary discoveries about a male society not wholly unlike our own. Surely we've all known a Greg or two, and through this book we may come to know them in a whole new light.","price":51.85,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2018-05-25T07:03:05.239668","updatedAt":"2021-09-18T23:55:37.347255"}

A chronicle of the witching hours between midnight and six a.m., this meditative book takes place during the two-year period in which Mutch's son Gabriel, who is autistic and also has Down syndrome, rarely slept through the night. In this tapestry composed of interwoven memories, we see both Gabriel's difficult childhood and Maria's introduction to the world of multiple disability parenting. As a counterpoint to Gabriel's figurative isolation is the story of Admiral Richard Byrd, the polar explorer who journeyed alone into the Antarctic wilderness in the 1930s. His story creates a shared and powerful language for the experience of feeling alone. In these three characters--mother, son, and explorer--Mutch reveals overlapping and layered themes of solitude that, far from driving us apart, enlighten, uplift, and connect.\"--Publisher description.","price":11.79,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2018-08-30T05:14:33.923146","updatedAt":"2022-12-07T02:11:01.723272"}

When he arrives in Jacksonville, he finds a rough-and-ready port town where he quickly learns a man is only as good as his fists. Though he's a city slicker who loves a game of chess and looks like an easy mark for the desperate men lurking in the shadows, Tom's also a trained boxer, lightning quick with his hands and afraid of no one. He heads west across Florida's wild frontier on the trail of the treasure, learning hard lessons of life for a Northern young man as he makes his way first on a riverboat to Palatka, then on a train to Ocala and Brooksville. His quick temper brings several brushes with death, including gator-filled swamps and a footrace with a stagecoach.\r\n\r\nThere are villians aplenty: the wooden-legged Elijah Dicken, the slick but mysterious Mr. Satin, and the rough DeBell clan. But Bridger also finds friends in Cheese Joseph, Archie Hankins, and the lovely and feisty Miss Lily. And he finds much more than he bargained for on the deserted west of Tampa. Back in New York his uncle Mike had trained young Tom in the art of boxing, and it all comes down to a match (London rules, i.e., no gloves) at the Point of Pines between Young Tom Bridger and Bongo Jones, the Key West Slasher. The story opened with a spectacular shipwreck, and the ending tops it with the big fistfight, a riot, a death, and a surprise.","price":15.8,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2009-12-09T22:24:44.731306","updatedAt":"2020-08-15T21:43:33.994129"}

However, in the past decade, a number of major Japanese companies have come under the control of foreign firms. Conflict and Change focuses on five Japanese companies acquired by foreign firms in the last ten years (including Nissan, Chugai Pharmaceutical and Shinsei Bank) to show how take-overs by foreign companies have changed HR and organisational practices traditionally associated with Japanese firms.

What parent doesn't think back longingly to a time when carefree play with other kids and a simpler life was the norm? Childhood should be a precious time of oasis from the realities of the adult world, yet in today's fast-paced, achievement-obsessed, ever-more-dangerous society, this is increasingly not the case.Based on renowned early childhood development expert Nancy Carlsson-Paige's thirty years of researching and writing about young children, this groundbreaking book helps parents navigate the cultural currents shaping, and too often harming, the lives of kids today and restore childhood to the very best of what it can and should be.There are three attributes critical to all children's healthy development, Carlsson-Paige explains: time and space for creative play, a feeling of security in today's often frightening world, and strong, meaningful relationships with both adults and other children—attributes that we, as a society, are failing to protect and nurture. Grounded in child development theory and research, Taking Back Childhood reveals practical, hands-on steps parents can take to create a safe, open, and imaginative environment in which kids can relish childhood and flourish as human beings.","price":48.41,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2009-12-09T22:28:33.301879","updatedAt":"2022-12-17T17:26:31.539220"}

While likening themselves to heterosexual couples, tombois and femmes contest and blur dominant constructions of gender and heterosexuality. Tombois are masculine females who identify as men and desire women; their girlfriends view themselves as normal women who desire men. \r\n\r\nThrough rich, in-depth, and provocative stories, author Evelyn Blackwood shows how these same-sex Indonesian couples negotiate transgressive identities and desires and how their experiences speak to the struggles and desires of sexual and gender minorities everywhere. Blackwood analyzes the complex and seemingly contradictory practices of tombois and their partners, demonstrating how they make sense of Islamic, transnational, and modern state discourses in ways that seem to align with normative gender and sexual categories while at the same time subverting them. \r\n\r\nThe childhood and adolescent narratives of tombois and femmes offer bold new insights into a social process that is rarely addressed in anthropological, lesbian, gay, or transgender studies. We see how tombois and femmes come to view themselves as boys and girls, respectively, through their interactions with family and community, and how as teenagers tombois learn that masculinity needs its opposite: feminine women. By contrast femmes notice shifts in their desires as they develop long-term relationships with tombois. \r\n\r\nThe book reveals the complexity of tomboi masculinity, showing how tombois enact both masculine and feminine behaviors as they move between the anonymity and vulnerability of public spaces and the familiarity of family spaces. Falling into the Lesbi World demonstrates how nationally and globally circulating queer discourses are received and reinterpreted by tombois and femmes in a city in Indonesia. Though less educated than many internet-savvy activists in major urban centers, their identities are clearly both part of yet different than global gay models of sexuality. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to the international LGBT model of modern sexualities, this work reveals a multiplicity of sexual and gender subjectivities in Indonesia, arguing for the importance of recognizing and validating this diversity in the global gay ecumene.","price":56.93,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2019-02-10T14:06:04.937306","updatedAt":"2022-12-24T03:53:28.861133"}

Before Martin Luther King, before Malcolm X, Bayard Rustin was working to bring the cause to the forefront of America's consciousness. A teacher to King, an international apostle of peace, and the organizer of the famous 1963 March on Washington, he brought Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence to America and helped launch the civil rights movement. Nonetheless, Rustin has been largely erased by history, in part because he was an African American homosexual. Acclaimed historian John D'Emilio tells the full and remarkable story of Rustin's intertwined lives: his pioneering and public person and his oblique and stigmatized private self. It was in the tumultuous 1930s that Bayard Rustin came of age, getting his first lessons in politics through the Communist Party and the unrest of the Great Depression. \r\n\r\nA Quaker and a radical pacifist, he went to prison for refusing to serve in World War II, only to suffer a sexual scandal. His mentor, the great pacifist A. J. Muste, wrote to him, \"You were capable of making the 'mistake' of thinking that you could be the leader in a revolution...at the same time that you were a weakling in an extreme degree and engaged in practices for which there was no justification.\" Freed from prison after the war, Rustin threw himself into the early campaigns of the civil rights and anti-nuclear movements until an arrest for sodomy nearly destroyed his career. Many close colleagues and friends abandoned him. \r\n\r\nFor years after, Rustin assumed a less public role even though his influence was everywhere. Rustin mentored a young and inexperienced Martin Luther King in the use of nonviolence. He planned strategy for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference until Congressman Adam Clayton Powell threatened to spread a rumor that King and Rustin were lovers. Not until Rustin's crowning achievement as the organizer of the 1963 March on Washington would he finally emerge from the shadows that homophobia cast over his career. Rustin remained until his death in 1987 committed to the causes of world peace, racial equality, and economic justice. \r\n\r\nBased on more than a decade of archival research and interviews with dozens of surviving friends and colleagues of Rustin's, Lost Prophet is a triumph. Rustin emerges as a hero of the black freedom struggle and a singularly important figure in the lost gay history of the mid-twentieth century. John D'Emilio's compelling narrative rescues a forgotten figure and brings alive a time of great hope and great tragedy in the not-so-distant past.","price":66.05,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2009-12-09T22:32:45.252362","updatedAt":"2021-11-08T02:59:40.945627"}

For many, it is as if they are traveling to someplace entirely new and they must go there alone, with only faded directions back to their old lives. Often, even their loved ones can only guess at what they must be experiencing.The Lonely Patient is a clear-eyed and deeply affecting examination of the inner life of those grappling with illness. It looks into the chasm between the well and the sick by exploring and giving voice to the often unarticulated aspects of illness, offering people with illness—and their family and friends—a frank and intelligent discussion of how to negotiate the psychological and emotional aspects of what they are going through.Michael Stein, M.D., a professor of medicine at Brown University Medical School as well as an acclaimed novelist, uses the stories of a number of patients, including that of his beloved, terminally ill brother-in-law, Richard, to consider the personal narrative of sickness. What sets Stein's book apart is his intimate scrutiny of the uniqueness of each patient's experience, which he breaks into four parts—betrayal, terror, loss, and loneliness—and renders each in such a way that he opens a dialogue about our expectations of health and, after its shocking disappearance, of illness.Beautifully written and keenly insightful, The Lonely Patient is a valuable book for patients and their caregivers—as well as a probing inquiry into a universal experience.","price":1.73,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2009-12-09T22:36:07.669607","updatedAt":"2019-07-22T11:28:58.078746"}

Using materials gathered across Mesoamerica, Oswaldo Chinchilla Mazariegos bridges the gap between written texts and artistic representations, identifying key mythical subjects and uncovering their variations in narratives and visual depictions. Central characters-including a secluded young goddess, a malevolent grandmother, a dead father, and the young gods who became the sun and the moon-are identified in pottery, sculpture, mural painting, and hieroglyphic inscriptions. Highlighting such previously overlooked topics as sexuality and generational struggles, this beautifully illustrated book paves the way for a new understanding of Maya myths and their lavish expression in ancient art.","price":27.83,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2019-05-15T06:40:40.752638","updatedAt":"2020-08-24T16:34:14.469821"}

From African royals to accused witches, from Puerto Rican radicals to Arab immigrants, Stavans and Alcaraz use sardonic humor and irreverent illustrations to introduce some of the most fascinating characters in American history-- and to recount travesties and triumphs that mainstream accounts all too often ignore. What emerges is a colorful group portrait of these United States, one that champions America's progress while also acknowledging its missteps.

During a vacation in Spain, Frederik has an accident and his visit to the hospital reveals a brain tumor that is gradually altering his personality, confirming Mia's suspicions that her husband is no longer the man he used to be. Now she must protect herself and their teenage son, Niklas, from the strange, blunted being who lives in her husband's body--and with whom she must share her home, her son, and her bed. When it emerges that one year ago Frederik had defrauded his school of millions of crowns, the consequences of his condition envelope the entire community. Frederick's apparent lack of concern doesn't help, and longstanding friendships with colleagues are thrown by the wayside. Increasingly isolated, Mia faces more tough questions. Had his illness already changed him back then when he still seemed so happy? What are the legal ramifications? In her support group for spouses of people with brain injuries, Mia meets a defense attorney named Bernhard. Together they help prepare for Frederik's court case by immersing themselves in the latest brain research and in classic philosophical questions of free will, while simultaneously navigating the uncertain waters of their growing mutual infatuation. Jungersen's clear, spare prose and ceaseless plot twists will keep readers hooked until the last page\"--","price":3.64,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2019-05-23T05:56:56.492943","updatedAt":"2020-11-14T04:39:59.201352"}

Though science has vastly expanded our knowledge, it has also led us to adopt a worldview where we see ourselves as insignificant specks living in a mechanical universe. Now, insights from quantum physics reveal that our universe is, in fact, a vibrantly intelligent reality and that each of us plays a vital role in shaping it. In this groundbreaking book, Schwartz shows us how to integrate this new quantum worldview into our everyday lives, allowing us to transcend our limitations and open to infinite possibilities. The Possibility Principle reveals how we can apply the three core tenets of quantum physics - inseparability, uncertainty, and potentiality - to live the life we choose, free from the wounds of our past and the constraints of our old beliefs. You can learn to: develop a mastery of your thinking as you free yourself from the replication of old thought patterns; utilize the concept of wave collapse to realize that you are not imprisoned by your genes, brain chemistry, or past traumas; overcome anxiety and depression through a shift of mind; thrive in resilient relationships and develop powerful communication skills that foster empowerment and intimate connection; and embrace uncertainty to ride the waves of personal change.","price":32.17,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2019-05-24T00:28:55.214322","updatedAt":"2020-08-05T16:55:50.580487"}

Yet the remedy that economists and policy makers continue to miss is also miraculously simple. Good medicine takes more than amazing technology; it takes time--time to respond to bodies as well as data, time to arrive at the right diagnosis and the right treatment.

Borovaya suggests that the history of Ladino literature begins at least 200 years earlier than previously believed and that Ladino, like most other languages, had more than one functional style.

This book brings together excerpts from contemporary manuals to show how the U.S. Army fed and provisioned its troops in the 19th and early 20th century, lifting the lid on what daily life must have been like both for those preparing and consuming the rations. The first part of the book covers the development of rations, messing, and army cooking until the Civil War. During the Civil War the huge number of volunteers who had no experience of cooking meant that the health of the army was in danger, and the result was the first cook book for soldiers. Later in the century, training for army cooks was introduced, alongside an official manual. A large extract is included from the manual dating to 1896, when the U. S. Army was involved in the last skirmishes of the Indian Wars, the Spanish-American war, and the Philippine-American war. The manual prepares a cook for any eventuality whether in garrison, in the field , or on the march. As well as classic American fare such as chowder and Rhode Island pancakes, more exotic influences are apparent with such delights as Crimean Kebobs, Turkish pillau, and Tamales. Following the experience of providing rations for men campaigning overseas in warmer climates, and the infamous 'embalmed beef' scandal, later manuals, including the 1916 edition, offer a detailed consideration of nutrition for the men and also recipes for when the cook has only a camp fire, and no utensils, available. with many illustrations and diagrams, this is a fascinating exploration of 19th and early 20th century U.S. Army cooking.","price":37.25,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2019-05-24T03:42:05.891797","updatedAt":"2023-03-19T20:11:21.566812"}

In this sweeping work, he traces the anguished relation between how cities are built and how people live in them, from ancient Athens to twenty-first-century Shanghai. He shows how Paris, Barcelona, and New York City assumed their modern forms; rethinks the reputations of Jane Jacobs, Lewis Mumford, and others; and takes us on a tour of emblematic contemporary locations, from the backstreets of Medellin, Colombia, to the Google headquarters in Manhattan. Through it all, he laments that the \"closed city\"--segregated, regimented, and controlled--has spread from the global North to the exploding urban agglomerations of the global South. As an alternative, he argues for the \"open city,\" where citizens actively hash out their differences and planners experiment with urban forms that make it easier for residents to cope.","price":24.99,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2019-05-24T05:32:22.582356","updatedAt":"2023-05-05T01:32:23.601969"}

For centuries the range has inspired cultural pride and a vast outpouring of creative expression. Yet since the partition of Korea in the 1940s, situating them in the North, the Diamond Mountains have remained largely inaccessible to visitors, shrouding the site in legend, loss, and longing. This book examines the visual representation of this remarkable landscape from the 18th century to the present day. It explores how Jeong Seon (1676-1759) revolutionized Korean painting with his Diamond Mountains landscapes, replacing conventional generic imagery with specific detail and indelibly influencing generations of artists in his wake. It also discusses the potency of these mountains as an emblem of Korean cultural identity, as reflected in literature and in exquisitely detailed album leaves, handscrolls, hanging scrolls, and screens.

Alex Wagner has always been fascinated by stories of exile and migration. Her father's ancestors immigrated to the United States from Ireland and Luxembourg. Her mother fled Rangoon in the 1960s, escaping Burma's military dictatorship. In her professional life, Wagner reported from the Arizona-Mexico border, where agents, drones, cameras, and military hardware guarded the line between two nations. She listened to debates about whether the United States should be a melting pot or a salad bowl. She knew that moving from one land to another--and the accompanying recombination of individual and tribal identities--was the story of America. And she was happy that her own mixed-race ancestry and late twentieth-century education had taught her that identity is mutable and meaningless, a thing we make rather than a thing we are. When a cousin's offhand comment threw a mystery into her personal story--introducing the possibility of an exciting new twist in her already complex family history--Wagner was suddenly awakened to her own deep hunger to be something, to belong, to have an identity that mattered, a tribe of her own. Intoxicated by the possibility, she became determined to investigate her genealogy. So she set off on a quest to find the truth about her family history. The journey takes Wagner from Burma to Luxembourg, from ruined colonial capitals with records written on banana leaves to Mormon databases and high-tech genetic labs. As she gets closer to solving the mystery of her own ancestry, she begins to grapple with a deeper question: Does it matter? Is our enduring obsession with blood and land, race and identity, worth all the trouble it's caused us? The answers can be found in this deeply personal account of her search for belonging, a meditation on the things that define us as insiders and outsiders and make us think in terms of \"us\" and \"them.\" In this time of conflict over who we are as a country, when so much emphasis is placed on ethnic, religious, and national divisions, Futureface constructs a narrative where we all belong.\"--provided by publisher.","price":49.84,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2019-05-24T06:53:21.257236","updatedAt":"2023-01-15T05:49:56.433695"}

It is twenty-three minutes to midnight and you have already slept for four hours. What you will dream of tonight, no one will ever know. Even if you were to remember it when you wake up, you wouldn't have a language in which to communicate it to us, nor do I think that you quite understand what dreams are, I think that is still undefined for you, that your thoughts haven't grasped it yet, and that it therefore lies within that strange zone where it neither exists nor doesn't exist. The conclusion to one of the most extraordinary and original literary projects in recent years, Summer once again intersperses short vividly descriptive essays with emotionally-raw diary entries addressed directly to Knausgaard's newborn daughter. Writing more expansively and, if it is possible, even more intimately and unguardedly than in the previous three volumes, he mines with new depth his difficult memories of his childhood and fraught relationship with his own father. Documenting his family's life in rural Sweden and reflecting on a characteristically eclectic array of subjects--mosquitoes, barbeques, cynicism, and skin, to name just a few--he braids the various threads of the previous volumes into a moving conclusion. At his most voluminous since My Struggle, his epic sensational series, Knausgaard writes for his daughter, striving to make ready and give meaning to a world at once indifferent and achingly beautiful. In his hands, the overwhelming joys and insoluble pains of family and parenthood come alive with uncommon feeling\"--\n\n\"Summer is the fourth volume of the Seasons quartet, a collection of short prose and diaries written by a father for his youngest daughter, with stunning artwork by Anselm Kiefer\" --","price":86.76,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2019-05-24T10:20:26.426626","updatedAt":"2022-12-20T23:48:18.761353"}

Built in the 1940s atop an infamous Italian slum, Cabrini-Green grew to twenty-three towers and a population of 20,000--all of it packed onto just seventy acres a few blocks from Chicago's ritzy Gold Coast. Cabrini-Green became synonymous with crime, squalor, and the failure of government. For the many who lived there, it was also a much-needed resource--it was home. By 2011, every high-rise had been razed, the island of black poverty engulfed by the white affluence around it, the families dispersed. In this novelistic and eye-opening narrative, Ben Austen tells the story of America's public housing experiment and the changing fortunes of American cities. It is an account told movingly through the lives of residents who struggled to make a home for their families as powerful forces converged to accelerate the housing complex's demise. Beautifully written, rich in detail, and full of moving portraits, High-Risers is a sweeping exploration of race, class, popular culture, and politics in modern America that brilliantly considers what went wrong in our nation's effort to provide affordable housing to the poor--and what we can learn from those mistakes.","price":1.82,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2019-05-24T10:32:23.288657","updatedAt":"2022-12-17T16:56:39.376604"}

Rupert died by smashing his Hispano-Suiza on a Cotswold country road while carrying a French mademoiselle in the passenger seat. With the house now Addie's, needed improvements in hand, and a weekend house party underway, how inconvenient of Rupert to turn up! Not in the flesh, but in - actually, as a - spirit. Rupert has to perform a few good deeds before becoming welcomed to heaven - or, more likely, thinks Addie, to hell. Before Addie can convince herself she's not completely lost her mind, a murder disrupts her careful seating arrangement. Which of her twelve houseguests is a killer? Her mother, the formidable Dowager Marchioness of Broughton? Her sister Cecilia, the born-again vegetarian? Her childhood friend and potential lover, Lord Lucas Waring?

A man was convicted of the brutal crime, but decades later questions still linger. For as long as he can remember, filmmaker Cody Swift has been haunted by the deaths of his childhood best friends. The loose ends of the police investigation consume him so much that he decides to return to Bristol in search of answers. Hoping to uncover new evidence and to encourage those who may be keeping long-buried secrets to speak up, Cody starts a podcast to record his findings. But there are many people who don't want the case, along with old wounds, reopened so many years after the tragedy, especially Charlie's mother, Jess, who decides to take matters into her own hands. When a long-dead body is found in the same location the boys were left decades before, the disturbing discovery launches another murder investigation.

Flow models are used when there is a flow of information or materials, such as fluid of money or energy between the components of a system. They are widely used in biomedicine but have also useful applications in studying ecosystems, input-output analysis, competition, models, and epidemology. In order to provide a complete and balanced presentation, the book is organized in four parts. Part 1 is devoted to the theory of digraphs; Part 2 addresses Markov chains; Part 3 discusses differential equations; and Part 4 presents the theory of compartmental models, addressing the relations between dynamics of the solution and structure of the model. Key applications discussed include ecosystem models, fluid transfer, competition models, tracer kinetic experiments, and network flows. Essential topics and methods are presented in an accessible style with many examples: directed graphs, differential equations, Markov chains, and compartmental model construction. The material provides a thorough and comprehensive presentation of compartmental models, model construction and applications. All advanced students, practitioners and professionals in bioscience and applied mathematical modeling will find the book a useful and excellent reference.","price":80.5,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2019-06-29T05:01:25.002610","updatedAt":"2019-06-29T05:01:25.002610"}

The observables are calculated within a nonrelativistic framework but with inclusion of lowest-order relativistic effects. Explicit meson exchange currents and isobar configurations as manifestation of subnuclear degrees of freedom are included in the calculation. The sensitivity of the various polarization observables with respect to subnuclear degrees of freedom, to electric and magnetic multipole contributions and to a variety of realistic potential models are systematically investigated. Thus this atlas provides the most detailed and systematic survey on polarization observables of this important process. It allows to analyse the different dynamical properties of the np-system as contained in the various observables and, therefore, will be useful for both theoretical studies and for the planning and evaluation of experiments as well. It serves in addition as an important supplement to the recent general review on deuteron photodisintegration by A. Arenhövel and M.

The invention of hardware description languages (HDLs) in the early 1960s was an attempt to remain at an abstract level in the design process, pushing the stage of physical implementation to the point at which no more technology-independent decisions need to be made. It was also an answer to the continuous, exponential growth in the complexity of the systems to be designed. This complexity has meant that systems have become unmanageable in human terms, requiring CAD support. Furthermore, HDL descriptions remain `implementation free', although increasingly precise and complete, meaning that the same system can undergo successive implementations over several technological generations. The first part of Fundamentals and Standards in Hardware Description Languages takes a look back over several decades, describing the mathematics, high level language concepts and system level methodology. This helps the reader to assimilate the theoretical background to the advanced application domains of HDLs, which are dealt with in the second part of the book. The third part provides a sampling of the most recent, fully implemented HDLs, demonstrating how new concepts can become a reality, how long it takes, and how long it will take to complete HDL up to the present level of knowledge.","price":73.9,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2019-06-30T16:39:25.550429","updatedAt":"2019-06-30T16:39:25.550429"}

However, its ultimate goal is to replace traditional illumination through LED lamps since LED lighting significantly reduces energy consumption and cuts down on carbon-dioxide emission. Despite dramatic advances in LED technologies (e.g., growth, doping and processing technologies), however, there remain critical issues for further improvements yet to be achieved for the realization of solid-state lighting. This book aims to provide the readers with some contemporary LED issues, which have not been comprehensively discussed in the published books and, on which the performance of LEDs is seriously dependent. For example, most importantly, there must be a breakthrough in the growth of high-quality nitride semiconductor epitaxial layers with a low density of dislocations, in particular, in the growth of Al-rich and and In-rich GaN-based semiconductors. The materials quality is directly dependent on the substrates used, such as sapphire, Si, etc. In addition, efficiency droop, growth on different orientations and polarization are also important. Chip processing and packaging technologies are key issues. This book presents a comprehensive review of contemporary LED issues. Given the interest and importance of future research in nitride semiconducting materials and solid state lighting applications, the contents are very timely. The book is composed of chapters written by leading researchers in III-nitride semiconducting materials and device technology. This book will be of interest to scientists and engineers working on LEDs for lighting applications. Postgraduate researchers working on LEDs will also benefit from the issues this book provides.","price":77.16,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2019-07-01T09:12:46.769452","updatedAt":"2022-02-27T07:32:11.094526"}

His recent books describe the \"new demons\" let loose upon the contemporary world by the double-edged achievements of science and industry. \r\nBut, he asserts in this latest book, the critics have gone too far. The West is the victim of a betrayal - that of its own children. Its intellectuals, most notably those of the Left, are necessarily the products of a civilized society. Yet they so loudly reproach this civilization for the atrocities and the destruction of rich local culture which have accompanied its growth that we are deaf to the reasoned voice which proclaims our debts to this Western tradition. \r\nWhile Ellul acknowledges the validity of these accusations, in The Betrayal of the West he points out that they are not peculiar to the West, that they are indeed inherent in the growth of any civilization. Ellul, as an historian, is a lover of civilization. He especially emphasizes the importance of the legacy of our own civilization. We are indebted tothe West for our concepts of freedom, equality, and above all, the idea of the individual. In his words, \"The West represents values for which there is no substitute. The West is a past, a difference, a shared history, and a shared human project... The end of the West today would mean the end of any possible civilization.\"\r\nThe Betrayal of the West explores the need for defense as well as critique of our culture. It explains the origins of the contradiction at the heart of Western civilization and traces the course of this dialectic in three supreme chapters constructed around metaphors which correspond to a promise, the challenge, and ultimately, the failure of the political left in Western societies. \r\nLe Monde has described this book as \"a classic,\" one in which Ellul \"is in effect a prophet and a visionary.\"","price":38.44,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2009-12-09T22:40:12.557861","updatedAt":"2023-04-14T15:30:09.168580"}

As he has done for historical phenomena as diverse as warfare, plague, and the pursuit of power, William McNeill brings a dazzling breadth and depth of knowledge to his study of dance and drill in human history. From the records of distant and ancient peoples to the latest findings of the life sciences, he discovers evidence that rhythmic movement has played a profound role in creating and sustaining human communities. The behavior of chimpanzees, festival village dances, the close-order drill of early modern Europe, the ecstatic dance-trances of shamans and dervishes, the goose-stepping Nazi formations, the morning exercises of factory workers in Japan - all these and many more figure in the bold picture McNeill draws. A sense of community is the key, and shared movement, whether dance or military drill, is its mainspring. McNeill focuses on the visceral and emotional sensations such movement arouses, particularly the euphoric fellow-feeling he calls \"muscular bonding.\" These sensations, he suggests, endow groups with a capacity for cooperation, which in turn improves their chance of survival.","price":94.75,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2019-07-04T20:34:30.225688","updatedAt":"2019-07-04T20:34:30.225688"}

Linguistic Geometry (LG) is an approach to the construction of mathematical models for large-scale multi-agent systems. A number of such systems, including air/space combat, robotic manufacturing, software re-engineering and Internet cyberwar, can be modeled as abstract board games. These are games with moves that can be represented by the movement of abstract pieces over locations on an abstract board. The purpose of LG is to provide strategies to guide the games' participants to their goals. Traditionally, discovering such strategies required searches in giant game trees. These searches are often beyond the capacity of modern and even conceivable future computers. LG dramatically reduces the size of the search trees, making the problems computationally tractable. LG provides a formalization and abstraction of search heuristics used by advanced experts including chess grandmasters. Essentially, these heuristics replace search with the construction of strategies. To formalize the heuristics, LG employs the theory of formal languages (i.e. formal linguistics), as well as certain geometric structures over an abstract board. The new formal strategies solve problems from different domains far beyond the areas envisioned by the experts. For a number of these domains, Linguistic Geometry yields optimal solutions.","price":76.56,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2019-07-05T03:19:50.448053","updatedAt":"2022-02-26T13:00:34.332174"}

Each electronic system poses different requirements on these oscillations, depending on the type and performance level of that specific system. It is the designer's challenge to find the specifications for the desired oscillation and to implement an electronic circuit meeting these specifications. As the desired oscillations have to fulfill many requirements, the design process can become very complex. To find an optimal solution, the designer requires a design methodology that is preferably completely top-down oriented. To achieve such a methodology, it must be assured that each property of the system can be optimized independently of all other properties. Oscillators and Oscillator Systems: Classification, Analysis and Synthesis takes a systematic approach to the design of high-performance oscillators and oscillator systems. A fundamental classification of oscillators, based on their internal timing references, forms the basis of this approach. The classification enables the designer to make strategic design decisions at a high hierarchical level of the design process. Techniques, derived from the systematic approach, are supplied to the designer to enable him or her to bring the performance of the system as close as possible to the fundamental limits. Oscillators and Oscillator Systems: Classification, Analysis and Synthesis is an excellent reference for researchers and circuit designers, and may be used as a text for advanced courses on the topic.","price":24,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2019-07-06T03:50:51.207412","updatedAt":"2021-10-04T20:36:28.307239"}

Yet the technical infrastructure that allows individuals, groups and corporations to have virtual relationships is rarely discussed in management books, and if so, the relationship between technology and the managerial issues is glossed over, or not properly elaborated. This textbook, designed for final year undergraduates and MBA students, considers the theory and practice of virtual organizations at three levels: the individual, the group, and the corporation. The justification for this approach is that at each level one sees manifestations of different problems that have to be considered in the design and implementation of relevant tools. These problems center on how information is used or, more precisely, how it is accessed, created, communicated, and reused once again. The technology appropriate for individuals may be different from the technology for groups or corporations. Ultimately, the reader should get a better understanding of the relationship between people and technology.","price":34.19,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2019-07-07T16:33:22.005397","updatedAt":"2021-12-29T04:05:09.194680"}

The VU becomes a metaphor for lean, flexible electricity production/delivery and flexible, customer-oriented energy service provision.

Just as traditional contingent claims, a weather derivative has an underlying measure, such as: rainfall, wind, snow or temperature.  Nearly $1 trillion of the U.S. economy is directly exposed to weather-related risk.  More precisely, almost 30% of the U.S. economy and 70% of U.S. companies are affected by weather.  The purpose of this monograph is to conduct an in-depth analysis of financial products that are traded in the weather market. Presenting a pricing and modeling approach for weather derivatives written on various underlying weather variables will help students, researchers, and industry professionals accurately price weather derivatives, and will provide strategies for effectively hedging against weather-related risk.  This book will link the mathematical aspects of the modeling procedure of weather variables to the financial markets and the pricing of weather derivatives.  Very little has been published in the area of weather risk, and this volume will appeal to graduate-level students and researchers studying financial mathematics, risk management, or energy finance, in addition to investors and professionals within the financial services industry.</p>","price":78,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2019-07-08T05:04:07.068934","updatedAt":"2021-10-05T03:35:01.484422"}

The defense of side two rests in large part on a refutation of the proposition that persons are automata -- a refutation involving an array of issues, from free will to Gödel to introspection to Searle and beyond. The defense of side one brings the reader face to face with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as they tackle perhaps their toughest case (`Silver Blaze'); the upshot of this visit with Conan Doyle's duo is an algorithm-sketch for the solving of murder mysteries.

His inventions, patents, and theoretical work formed the basis of modern AC electricity, and contributed to the development of radio and television. Like his competitor Thomas Edison, Tesla was one of America's first celebrity scientists, enjoying the company of New York high society and dazzling the likes of Mark Twain with his electrical demonstrations. An astute self-promoter and gifted showman, he cultivated a public image of the eccentric genius. Even at the end of his life when he was living in poverty, Tesla still attracted reporters to his annual birthday interview, regaling them with claims that he had invented a particle-beam weapon capable of bringing down enemy aircraft. Plenty of biographies glamorize Tesla and his eccentricities, but until now none has carefully examined what, how, and why he invented. In this groundbreaking book, W. Bernard Carlson demystifies the legendary inventor, placing him within the cultural and technological context of his time, and focusing on his inventions themselves as well as the creation and maintenance of his celebrity. Drawing on original documents from Tesla's private and public life, Carlson shows how he was an \"idealist\" inventor who sought the perfect experimental realization of a great idea or principle, and who skillfully sold his inventions to the public through mythmaking and illusion. This major biography sheds new light on Tesla's visionary approach to invention and the business strategies behind his most important technological breakthroughs\"--\n\n\"This is a biography of one of the major 20th-century scientists, Nikola Tesla.

From blind faith in ever rising housing prices to plummeting confidence in capital markets, \"animal spirits\" are driving financial events worldwide. In this book, the authors, both economists, challenge the economic wisdom that got us into this mess, and put forward a bold new vision that will transform economics and restore prosperity. They reassert the necessity of an active government role in economic policymaking by recovering the idea of \"animal spirits\", a term John Maynard Keynes used to describe the gloom and despondence that led to the Great Depression and the changing psychology that accompanied recovery. Like Keynes, they know that managing these animal spirits requires the steady hand of government; simply allowing markets to work won't do it. In rebuilding the case for a more robust, behaviorally informed Keynesianism, they detail the most pervasive effects of animal spirits (i.e. human psychology), in contemporary economic life, such as confidence, fear, bad faith, corruption, a concern for fairness, and the stories we tell ourselves about our economic fortune, and show how Reaganomics, Thatcherism, and the rational expectations revolution failed to account for them. The authors then offer a road map for reversing the financial misfortunes besetting us today; they teach how leaders can channel animal spirits, the powerful forces of human psychology that are afoot in the world economy today, and making them work for and not against us.\n\nThis text provides a picture of how a capitalist economy works, especially at the macro level. It considers eight questions about the working of the economy. This provides the background that is necessary to take on other questions about macroeconomic policy, finance, bankruptcy law, and others, and to begin to answer them.","price":57.31,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2019-07-19T03:49:55.189602","updatedAt":"2021-08-06T23:17:04.969030"}

During her lifetime, Belgian-born British actress Audrey Hepburn (1929-1993), star of such films as Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Funny Face, Breakfast at Tiffany's, My Fair Lady, Charade, and Two for the Road, was recognized around the world. Two decades after her death, Hepburn remains one of the most celebrated actresses of all time, inspiring new generations of admirers. Here, Hepburn's career is charted from her early years in London as a student of ballet and a performer on the West End stage to her Hollywood heyday to her final years as a special ambassador for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Alongside work by the renowned photographers whose portraits defined Hepburn's image and shaped her career are publicity photographs, images during the production of her films, as well as rare family photographs and other informal archive pictures. Possessing the features, height, and poise of a model, Hepburn collaborated with such couturiers as Hubert de Givenchy, and her image graced the pages and covers of Harper's Bazaar and other fashion magazines. She was photographed by legends, including Richard Avedon, whose work is represented here, together with portraits by Cecil Beaton, Antony Beauchamp, Philippe Halsman, Angus McBean, Norman Parkinson, and Irving Penn. An iconic figure whose image-- including her unmistakable silhouette from Breakfast at Tiffany's-- left an indelible impact on many cultural contexts, Hepburn played an essential role in the development of celebrity and visual culture in the twentieth century.","price":6.73,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2019-07-19T05:42:28.616382","updatedAt":"2023-03-11T04:30:49.412866"}

The common response of traditional medicine has been to prescribe opioid painkillers, which can lead to overdose and addiction. Over the past ten years, Dr. Peter Przekop has developed a revolutionary alternative program to manage pain that goes well beyond the short-term relief of prescription painkillers. Przekop discovered that pain can become chronic, not just because of the trauma that caused it, but because the brain becomes programmed to recreate the experience of pain as a coping mechanism. Retrain Your Brain to Conquer Chronic Pain will help you return to pain-free functioning. Gain the same insights Dr. Przekop has brought to hundreds of chronic pain sufferers by learning how the brain can be reprogrammed to alleviate pain. You'll also learn how chronic stress, adversity, and negative emotions influence how we experience and interpret pain and what to do to reverse the pattern. Dr. Przekop provides a daily routine of exercises that have proven effective in managing chronic pain, often completely relieving it and the deep despair it can cause. Following his program brings the mind and body into harmony so that the psychological function that chronic pain previously served is no longer necessary. \"--","price":28.22,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2019-07-19T06:15:06.077990","updatedAt":"2020-09-21T06:28:00.292175"}

The author challenges the assumption that growth can be perpetual and questions the ability of political leaders to enact the tough structural changes needed. He is particularly critical of the \"easy money\" approach to dealing with the great recession of 2008, citing the dangers of excessive debt and deep-seated fundamental imbalances. The fallout of these poor policies, he argues, will affect not only the business sector, but also the lifestyles and prosperity of average citizens and future generations. The author concludes with a thought experiment illustrating the large-scale changes that will be necessary to restore economic, financial, and social sustainability.

At the age of five, his parents went through a bitter divorce. Eric moved away with his mother, whose new husband, Serge, quickly grew to resent Eric and seemed to delight in making him miserable. The only place Eric felt at home was the kitchen, where his mother tried to cheer him up with lavish meals, but once the plates had been cleared, his unhappiness returned. Then he met Jacques, a locally renowned chef and restaurant owner. Jacques took Eric under his wing, letting him into his kitchen everyday after school where he would teach Eric how to make real chocolate mousse and regale him with stories from his travels. Watching Jacques and the obvious pride he took in his work, Eric began to see a future for himself, one in which his lifelong love of food could become something that he shared with other people. His desire to not only cook but to become the best would lead him into some of the most celebrated and demanding kitchens in Paris, serving under legendary chefs like Joel Robuchon and Jean Louis Palladin and trying to survive the brutal, exacting environment of their kitchens. Like Jacques Pepin's classic memoir The Apprentice, Eric Ripert's is a coming of age story about how he learned to cook and finally found his place in the kitchen\"--","price":26.68,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2019-07-19T12:26:02.690365","updatedAt":"2022-12-20T15:59:23.721593"}

Alain Bresson is one of the world's leading authorities in the field, and he is helping to redefine it. Here he combines a thorough knowledge of ancient sources with innovative new approaches grounded in recent economic historiography to provide a detailed picture of the Greek economy between the last century of the Archaic Age and the closing of the Hellenistic period. Focusing on the city-state, which he sees as the most important economic institution in the Greek world, Bresson addresses all of the city-states rather than only Athens. An expanded and updated English edition of an acclaimed work originally published in French, the book offers a groundbreaking new theoretical framework for studying the economy of ancient Greece; presents a masterful survey and analysis of the most important economic institutions, resources, and other factors; and addresses some major historiographical debates. Among the many topics covered are climate, demography, transportation, agricultural production, market institutions, money and credit, taxes, exchange, long-distance trade, and economic growth. The result is an unparalleled demonstration that, unlike just a generation ago, it is possible today to study the ancient Greek economy as an economy and not merely as a secondary aspect of social or political history.

Solovyov (1853-1900) was one of the most remarkable figures of the 19th century: He was the most important Russian speculative thinker of that century, publishing major works on theoretical philosophy, the philosophy of religion, and ethics; he also produced sensitive literary criticism and incisive essays on current political, social, and ecclesiastical questions. The eminent theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar designated Solovyov as the greatest artist of conceptual order and organization--after Thomas Aquinas--in the entire history of thought, a thinker who borrows from all systems after purging them of their negations. Solovyov was also the first major Russian thinker to enter into ecumenical dialogue with Jewish scholars and theologians, and Glazov's main concern is (1) to translate as completely as possible all of Solovyov's writings on Judaism and to annotate these texts by identifying persons, places, and citations, especially in the Biblical and rabbinic literature; and (2) to synthesize the information gleaned from these writings with key recollections of Solovyov's attitudes toward Jews and Judaism by his immediate family, friends, and early biographers.

He's come back to New York City after a long absence, and though he'd much rather spend his days drinking artisanal beer in his favorite local bar, his old friends-- and his enemies-- have other plans for him. One night M might find himself squaring off against the pirates who cruise the Gowanus Canal; another night sees him at a fashionable uptown charity auction where the waitstaff are all zombies. A subway ride through the inner circles of hell? In M's world, that's practically a pleasant diversion.

To stop it, M will have to call in every favor, waste every charm, and blow every spell he's ever acquired-- he might even have to get out of bed before noon.

Yet, today in the United States, laws exist at all levels of government that actually make these problems worse. Baylen Linnekin argues that, too often, government rules handcuff America's most sustainable farmers, producers, sellers, and consumers, while rewarding those whose practices are anything but sustainable.Bitting the Hands that Feed Us introduces readers to the perverse consequences of many food rules. Some of these rules constrain the sale of 'ugly' fruits and vegetables, relegating bushels of tasty but misshapen carrots and strawberries to food waste. Other rules have threatened to treat manure--the lifeblood of organic fertilization--as a toxin. Still other rules prevent sharing food with the homeless and others in need. There are even rules that prohibit people from growing fruits and vegetables in their own yards. Linnekin also explores what makes for a good food law--often, he explains, these emphasize good outcomes rather than rigid processes. But he urges readers to be wary of efforts to regulate our way to a greener food system, calling instead for empowerment of those working to feed us (and themselves) sustainably\"--Amazon.com","price":64.98,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2019-07-19T17:55:07.159699","updatedAt":"2023-03-08T13:42:13.825096"}

With two big cases under her belt, FBI Agent Jessica Blackwood is learning to embrace her unconventional past as the rising star in a family dynasty of illusionists. Her talent and experience endow her with a unique understanding of the power and potential of deception, and a gift for knowing when things are not always as they appear to be.

It fails to capture the faith and grace, the peace and beauty of her devotion to the God of Death. She is not, to her mind, an assassin, not a murderer--she is a priestess. At least, she will be a priestess if she manages to pass her final trial.  The problem isn't the killing. Pyrre has been killing and training to kill, studying with some of the most deadly men and women in the world, since she was eight. The problem, strangely, is love. To pass her Trial, Pyrre has ten days to kill the ten people enumerated in an ancient song, including \"the one you love / who will not come again.\"  Pyrre is not sure she's ever been in love. If she were a member of a different religious order, a less devoted, disciplined order, she might cheat. The Priests of Ananshael, however, don't look kindly on cheaters. If Pyrre fails to find someone to love, or fails to kill that someone, they will give her to the god.  Pyrre's not afraid to die, but she hates to quit, hates to fail, and so, with a month before her trial begins, she returns to the city of her birth, the place where she long ago offered an abusive father to the god and abandoned a battered brother--in the hope of finding love...and ending it on the edge of her sword. -- Back cover.","price":84.42,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2019-07-19T23:08:42.873162","updatedAt":"2020-08-17T00:50:49.738120"}

The editors argue that charter schools are playing a powerful role in reviving participation in public education, expanding opportunities for progressive methods in public school classrooms, and generating new energy for community-based, community-controlled school initiatives.

Whilst much has been written over the years about teacher stress and burnout, there is very little research which reports on the conditions which are essential for teachers to sustain their commitment and effectiveness over their professional lives, in contexts of challenge and change. Drawing upon a range of educational, psychological, socio-cultural and neuro-scientific research, together with vivid accounts from teachers in a variety of primary and secondary schools internationally, and from their own research on teachers' work and identities, the authors discuss the dynamic nature, forms and practices of teacher resilience. They argue that resilience in teachers is not only their ability to bounce back in extremely adverse circumstances but that it is the capacity of teachers for everyday resilience which enables them to sustain their commitment and effectiveness in responding positively to the unavoidable uncertainties inherent of their professional lives. The authors conclude that resilience in teachers can be nurtured by the intellectual, social and organisational environments in which teachers work and live, rather than being simply a personal attribute or trait, determined by nature. Resilient Teachers, Resilient Schools will be of key interest to policy makers, head teachers, teachers and training and development organisations who wish to improve quality and standards in schools\"--","price":47.61,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2019-12-13T23:29:27.090347","updatedAt":"2020-11-14T04:18:39.932853"}

This book discusses undeveloped human telepathy and contrasts it with the probable existence of fully developed alien telepathy, which may have many different forms. Ingo also explores the fact that we officially know far more than we're admitting about the Moon -- its origins, its atmosphere, its occupants and many other unusual features. \r\nPenetration is about one of the means by which we can learn more about those not of this earth (and vice-versa) -- telepathy. Do we have the means to answer some very important questions that many have been asking for quite a long time? Inside this book are the answers to some.\r\n\r\nPLUS...In a newly discovered missing chapter on his psychic probes of Mars (\"9\") to Penetration, Ingo asserts that there is a bigger question at play – the question as to “why do mass-consciousness humans, as it were, mass-consciously almost 'conspire' to avoid certain issues, and consistently so?” This inquiry, deep within Ingo’s own awareness, is one that he would ponder until his passing in 2013. He no doubt wished to share this interrogation with the world back in 1998, but was uncertain how. Thus to commemorate and celebrate his birth sign (Virgo), we have put Ingo’s question to the world by including “9” along with an Introductions by Dr. Krippner and Dr. Mitchell and Afterword by Thomas McNear, Lieutenant Colonel U.S. Army (Ret.), in this Special Edition","price":45.56,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2020-02-10T03:01:54.301383","updatedAt":"2020-02-10T03:08:18.168821"}

In claiming this autonomy of desire, language is pushed to its dark edges, the astonishing dunefields and forests where pleasure and love are both grief and joy, violence and sensuality.\r\n \r\nDiaz defies the conditions from which she writes, a nation whose creation predicated the diminishment and ultimate erasure of bodies like hers and the people she loves: “I am doing my best to not become a museum / of myself. I am doing my best to breathe in and out. // I am begging: Let me be lonely but not invisible.” Postcolonial Love Poem unravels notions of American goodness and creates something more powerful than hope—a future is built, future being a matrix of the choices we make now, and in these poems, Diaz chooses love.","price":53.28,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2020-06-03T13:20:55.166021","updatedAt":"2022-12-14T21:34:31.052861"}

Saying 'yes' means the chance to build her own dream home, but she'll also have to face the past and hear some uncomfortable truths ... With interference from an evil boss, warring parents, an unreliable boyfriend and an architect who puts his foot in it every time he opens his mouth, will Sophie be able to build a future on her own terms - and maybe even find love along the way? A totally charming, modern love story for fans of Katie Fforde, Carole Matthews and Trisha Ashley. Praise for Cathy Bramley: \"Delightfully warm and with plenty of twists and turns.\" (Trisha Ashley). \"A witty, laugh-out-loud romantic comedy ... I highly recommend it!\" (Miranda Dickinson).","price":76.94,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2020-06-04T05:25:10.278168","updatedAt":"2020-08-04T17:00:13.208231"}

This Open Access title presents a series of case studies designed to highlight practical responses to these changes from the national, state, and local levels. This book is designed to be a companion piece to The Future of Election Administration, which surveys these critical dimensions of elections from the perspectives of the most forward-thinking practitioner, policy, advocacy, and research experts and leaders in these areas today. Drawing upon principles of professionalism and the practical work that is required to administer elections as part of the complex systems, this book lifts up the voices and experiences of practitioners from around the country to describe, analyze, and anticipate the key areas of election administration systems on which students, researchers, advocates, policy makers, and practitioners should focus. Together, these books add to the emerging body of literature that is part of the election sciences community with an emphasis on the practical aspects of administration.","price":7.62,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2020-06-04T14:06:50.545613","updatedAt":"2022-12-18T03:45:08.959300"}

Until the night she meets Rafe Martinelli and decides to change the direction of her life.

The King, his retinue and anyone with sufficient means has fled the plague-ridden city, its half-deserted streets echoing the sound of bells tolling the mounting number of deaths. Those who remain clutch doubtful potions to ward off the relentless disease and dart nervously past shuttered buildings, watchful for the thieves who risk their lives to plunder what has been left behind. At Chelsea, a rural backwater by the river, with fine mansions leased to minor members of the Court avoiding the capital, there are more immediate concerns: the government has commandeered the theological college to house Dutch prisoners of war, and there are daily rumours that those sailors are on the brink of escaping. Moreover, a vicious strangler is stalking the neighbourhood. Thomas Chaloner is sent to investigate the murder of the first victim, an inmate of a private sanatorium known as Gorges. There have been thefts there as well, but the few facts he gleans from inmates and staff are contradictory and elusive. He realises, though, that Gorges has stronger links to the prison than just proximity and that the influx of strangers offers plenty of camouflage for a killer - a killer who has no compunction about turning on those determined to stop his murderous rampage.","price":46.59,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2020-07-19T04:47:11.222127","updatedAt":"2020-08-24T11:47:01.732138"}

It offers an extended intellectual and creative engagement with the affordances of computer software through multiple readings and re-writings of a singular text, the source code of the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer or the ?AGC.? Moonbit re-marks and remixes the code that made space travel possible. Half of this book is erasure poetry that uses the AGC code as the source text, building on the premise that code can speak beyond its functional purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen we think about the 1960s U.S. space program and obscure scientific computer code, we might not first think about the Watts riots, Shakespeare, Winnie the Pooh, T.S.

Yet these cultural references and influences along with many more are scattered throughout the body of the code that powered the compact digital computer that successfully guided astronauts to the Moon and back and in July of 1969. Moonbit unravels and rewrites the many embedded cultural references that were braided together within the language resources of mid-century computer code.\r\n\r\nMoonbit also provides a gentle, non-expert introduction to the text of the AGC code, to digital poetics, and to critical code studies. Outlining a capacious interpretive practice, Moonbit takes up all manner of imaginative decodings and recodings of this code.

The author shows that the project-based organisation of this form of basic vocational training, in which learners change companies several times, constitutes new mechanisms of social inequality in the field of basic vocational training. This is due to the fact that training company networks place substantially higher demands on the self-organisation and flexibility of learners than traditional apprenticeships. A confident handling of these requirements requires specific prerequisites and resources that are unequally distributed in terms of social structure. Nevertheless, training company networks also offer the opportunity to reduce social inequality. The prerequisite for this is that training company networks do not presuppose the unevenly distributed key competences such as flexibility and self-organisation, which are fundamental to working life, as skills, but rather systematically impart them during training. In addition, framework conditions must be created which make it possible for learners from less privileged backgrounds to master the challenges of collaborative training.","price":26.01,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2020-07-21T03:38:19.357096","updatedAt":"2020-07-21T03:38:19.357096"}

The book holds eight articles focusing on historical phases which have been particularly influenced by social and political mobilization. Thus, the book traces an oppositional tradition across borders in time and space. Although the articles are based on limited studies, the authors write with ambition to include their research into this wider context.\r\n\r\nIn Norway, the Constitution of 1814 marks the shift from autocratic rule to early democracy. 18th century peasant riots may be interpreted as expressions of impotence of the common people, but also as an opportunity for action with the potential to influence the authorities. The 19th century peasant opposition shows the potential for change through parliamentary representation. Around 1850 the first attempts at worker?s organizations were criminalized ? around 1950, however, the Labour Party dominated Norwegian politics. These trending lines reflect an increasingly developed democracy. The political system is in principle opening for broad popular participation. However, democracy is still being challenged by opposition in ways and by means that occasionally raise concerns about the stability of our political culture.\r\n\r\nThe book is divided into three parts. Part I is dedicated to the age of late autocracy, part II provides insights into the 19th century democratization processes, while Part III includes articles dealing with opposition and confrontations in the last century, focusing the interwar period, the 1970s, and today's multicultural society.The book is aimed both at researchers, students and the general audience.\"\r\n","price":97.36,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2020-07-21T04:07:12.537827","updatedAt":"2020-07-21T04:07:12.537827"}

Child death was the great equaliser of the early modern period, affecting people of all ages and conditions. It is well recognised that the deaths of children struck at the heart of early modern families, yet less known is the variety of ways that not only parents, but siblings, communities and even nations, responded to childhood death. The contributors to this volume ask what emotional responses to child death tell us about childhood and the place of children in society. Placing children and their voices at the heart of this investigation, they track how emotional norms, values, and practices shifted across the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries through different religious, legal and national traditions. This collection demonstrates that child death was not just a family matter, but integral to how communities and societies defined themselves.\r\n\r\nChapter 5 of this book is available open access under a CC BY 4.0 license at link.springer.com.","price":22.9,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2020-07-21T04:18:20.410095","updatedAt":"2020-07-21T04:18:20.410095"}

The submission of the work for publication is being filed concurrently with the final report on the project to the FWF. The significance of the Pez letters, of which the submitted volume will make roughly one quarter available to the public for the first time, is twofold. On the one hand, the European scope of the correspondence leads to a re-evaluation of the position of Austria and southern Germany within European intellectual history of the early 18th century and within the erudite practice and culture of communication in the Republic of Letters. On the other hand, the prosopographical orientation of the brothers' project (a collection of bio-bibliographical data on Benedictine authors of the 16th to 18th century) provides the beginnings of an inventory and topography of a nearly undiscovered intellectual landscape.\nThe volume contains: an introduction sketching the various monastic and erudite contexts of the correspondence, presenting learned letters as a literary genre, and setting out the principles of the edition; the edition itself, which gives 261 extant letters in the original Latin with critical notes, German summaries and commentary, and which also registers 211 lost letters; an appendix with biographical information on the 82 correspondents and four tables (letters by correspondents, letters in chronological order, items enclosed with the letters, mentioned letters between third persons); sources and bibliography; finally a cumulative bio-bibliographical index.\nPublication is envisioned within the series \"Quelleneditionen des Instituts für Österreichische Geschichtsforschung\" (Böhlau publishing house) as the first of four planned volumes of the correspondence.

{"_id":{"$oid":"64e3d055c330effc84b20b15"},"title":"Ohnmacht und Chance","subjects":["History","Europe, history"],"description":"This study takes as its point of departure the diet in the summer of the year 1579 in Vienna. Leonhard von Harrach, Privy Councellor of Emperor Rudolf II, negotiated with leaders of the oppositional protestant nobility, who wanted to push through freedom of religious confession in the landesherrlichen cities and market towns in Lower Austria. Analysis of Harrachs's connections to opposition, his scope of action as a member of the government, councellor and mentor of the young, Spanish-catholic oriented Kaiser, professional court politician, nobleman, leader of an Austrian power elite, head of the 'House of Harrach' and a Catholic interested in reaching reconciliation with the protestants, can show the special structures of this conflict. The historiographic basis had largely to be assembled from scratch since, e.g., in recorded histories and chronics very little mention is made of an Austrian power elite within the Habsburg monarchy of the 16th century, which consisted of land-owning noblemen. The existence of this power elite has considerable consequences in gaining a proper understanding of the 'dualism' of Ständestaat as a complex dualistic system of political cooperation in the Habsburg monarchy. This power elite of functionaries from the lower nobility had a strong position in court and administration and also in estates in the Eastern hereditary lands of the Habsburgs. Noble families such as the Roggendorf, Jörger, Hoffmann, Windischgrätz or Khevenhüller, all in the same social network as Harrach, were among the most prominent families to profit from the more central organization of the state and at the same time they produced the most important leaders of the protestant opposition in Vienna and Graz. Although the conflict culture of the dualistic system wasn't strong enough against confessional polarization, the cooperation of the Habsburg dynasty with the court-oriented nobility from the provinces of the hereditary lands proved to be such a successful model of governmental organization that in the Austrian-Bohemian 'Dyarchy' it was continued on a larger scale.

But the polarization of religious confessions had destroyed the Irenic of Harrach. His initiation into the Spanish-catholic Habsburg Order of the Golden Fleece gave the decisive impulse, to take on, along with the Archduke Ernst, the overall direction of moderate, but compulsory re-Catholization of the Lower-Austrian cities and market towns, organized by Melchior Khlesl, official of the Bishopric Passau in Vienna. \r\n","price":49.84,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2020-07-21T05:15:24.285736","updatedAt":"2022-09-18T01:17:02.219504"}

In the late 1980s, the Alevis (roughly 15-20% of the population), at that time thought to be mostly assimilated into the secular Turkish mainstream, began to assert their difference as they never had before. As Dressler demonstrates, they began a revitalization and reformation of Alevi institutions and networks, demanded an end to social and institutional discrimination, and claimed recognition as a community distinct from the Sunni majority population. Both in Turkey and in countries with a significant Turkish migrant population, such as Germany, the \"Alevi question, \" which comprises matters of representation and relation to the state, as well as questions of cultural and religious location, has in the last two decades become a matter of public interest. Alevism is often assumed to be part of the Islamic tradition, although located on its margins - margins marked with indigenous terms such as Sufi and Shia, or with outside qualifiers such as 'heterodox' and 'syncretistic.' It is further assumed that Alevism is an intrinsic part of Anatolian and Turkish culture, carrying ancient Turkish heritage back beyond Anatolia and into the depths of the Central Asian Turkish past. Dressler argues that this knowledge about the Alevis, their demarcation as \"heterodox\" but Muslim, and their status as an intrinsic part of Turkish culture, is in fact much more recent. That knowledge can be traced back to the last years of the Ottoman Empire and the first years of the Turkish Republic, which was the decisive period of the formation of the Turkish nation state. Dressler contends that the Turkish nationalist reading of Alevism emerged as an anti-thesis to earlier Western interpretations. Both the initial Western/Orientalist discovery of the Alevis and their re-signification by Turkish nationalists are the cornerstones of the modern genealogy of the Alevism of Turkey. It is time, according to Dressler, for the origins of the Alevis to be demythologized\"--Provided by publisher.","price":72.57,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2020-07-27T09:23:33.998182","updatedAt":"2021-03-19T06:28:12.419338"}

A farmer and beekeeper, Jacqueline began compiling their communications.Through words and images, the bees shared a courageous view of their role on Earth, including their charge to propel forward the evolution of humankind and agriculture. Guided by the question \"How can I best help bees sing their natural song of increase,\" Jacqueline committed to a deeper, more relational and hands-off way of working with her bees to create treatment-free health and contentment in the hives. The bees explain why so many colonies are dying and what we can do to reverse the collapse. They discuss the higher role of drone bees (\"the holiest of beings\"), the importance of swarming, the crucial function of temperature to the health of the hive and the infant bees, and the secret of the Queen's prolonged and robust fertility. The bees offer a profoundly deeper explanation of pollination and even describe how honeybees can help heal humans with \"evolutionary medicine.\" Provocative and trail-blazing, this book clarifies fundamental changes that can transform our relationship with bees into one of deep partnership. In her compelling interweave of personal story, unique \"from the bees\" communications, and her years of beekeeping experience, Jacqueline invites us into an even larger and imperative conversation we all must begin with each other -- and with bees -- so that their long-term survival is ensured.

In this volume he offers an extensive assessment of the nature of politics and the search for order in Spanish politics, concentrating on the central figures who defended the Church and communities during the Spanish Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe book argues for the uniqueness of Spain among the other countries of Europe. For Wilson, the most salutary attribute of Spanish politics is found in the assemblage of smaller groupings of the citizenry within the larger society in communities; and it is in the smaller association that the most important aspects of moral, social and political life were nurtured. Part 1 includes assessments of three eminent Spanish traditionalists, Juan Donoso Cortés, Jaime Balmes, and Menéndez Pelayo, as well as studies of central figures from the period of the Spanish Civil War—José Antonio and Ramiro de Maeztu. The final chapters are taken from an unpublished book-length manuscript, “An Anchor in the Latin Mind,” that Wilson had completed at the time of his death in 1976, and was recently discovered by the editors. For Wilson, Latin thinkers possess advantages others do not—a political realism that can be reinvigorated.\r\n\r\nThe recovery of Spanish traditionalism, according to this book, is dependent upon a return to the self-understanding of the ordering principles of Spanish politics and society. Wilson’s affirmation of a Spanish traditionalist inheritance during his lifetime encouraged a return to authentic popular rule and a greater appreciation of Spanish achievements in politics and the moral life.\r\n\r\nH.

But she died an untimely death, and Poe was left alone with his father, Kes Dameron, who struggles with grief and a desire to keep his son safe.\r\n\r\nNow sixteen, Poe wants nothing more than to leave his home on the quiet moon Yavin 4 to find adventure in the wider galaxy, while his father wants nothing more than for him to stay put. So when a group of smugglers offers Poe a job piloting them off-world, it feels like an opportunity he can't refuse. And by the time he finds out the smugglers are actually part of the fearsome criminal enterprise called the Spice Runners of Kijimi, Poe is already in deep. His burgeoning friendship—and perhaps more—with one young Spice Runner, Zorii, is even more incentive for Poe to stick around. But is this the life he's meant to have, is it even the life he wants?

Now that nearly 85% of the Māori population have their main place of residence in urban centres, cities have become important sites of affirmation and struggle. Grounded in an ethnography of everyday life in the city of Auckland, Being Maori in the City is an investigation of what being Māori means today.\n\nOne of the first ethnographic studies of Māori urbanization since the 1970s, this book is based on almost two years of fieldwork, living with Māori families, and more than 250 hours of interviews. In contrast with studies that have focused on indigenous elites and official groups and organizations, Being Māori in the City shines a light on the lives of ordinary individuals and families.

Schwartz, the Air Force chief of staff, tasked the Air Force Research Institute (AFRI) to answer the following question: What critical capabilities--implemented by the combatant commanders--will the nation require of the Air Force by 2030? The AFRI team identified the nation's vital interests: commerce; secure energy supplies; freedom of action at sea, in space, in cyberspace, and in the skies; nuclear deterrence; and regional stability. The team analyzed four future world scenarios--a peer competitor, resurgent power, failed state, and jihadist insurgency--in relation to the nation's vital interests and the 12 Air Force core functions. The resulting analysis led to a synthesis of the core functions into five critical capabilities designed to meet the Air Force's strategic challenges in 2030: power projection; freedom of action in air, space, and cyberspace; global situational awareness; air diplomacy; and military support to civil authorities.\"--Publisher's description.","price":30.4,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2020-09-23T02:13:59.109181","updatedAt":"2020-09-23T02:13:59.109181"}

In the displacement estimation based on the phase change of echoes, the displacement estimates are biased when the center frequency of the RF echo changes. Such an apparent change in the center frequency could be caused by the interference of echoes from scatterers. To reduce the influence of the center frequency variation on the estimation of motion and deformation, an error correcting function, which does not require the assumption that the center frequency distributions in 2 different frames are the same, was introduced. As a result, the proposed method provides better strain estimates in comparison with conventional phase-sensitive correlation methods. This monograph also shows examples of applications of this method to measurement of small motion and deformation of biological tissues. This method can be applied to measurement of elasticity of dynamic tissues, such as the artery. Also, elastic properties of static tissues can be also measured by combining with actuation using the acoustic radiation force.--","price":36.9,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2020-10-18T07:14:06.863679","updatedAt":"2020-10-18T07:14:06.863679"}

Eine Internetpräsenz ist nicht nur für den etablierten Kreis der Rundfunkveranstalter und der Zeitungs- und Zeitschriftenverlage, sondern für die gesamte Informationsgesellschaft unverzichtbar. Da Rundfunk und Presse durch unterschiedliche Ordnungsprinzipien gekennzeichnet sind, stossen im Internet zwei Welten aufeinander. Welche Welt gilt im Internet? Und insbesondere: Darf es oder muss es öffentlich-rechtliche Angebote auch im Internet geben? Eine Antwort auf diese Fragen kann nur dann gefunden werden, wenn man grundrechtstheoretischen Boden betritt. Die Konzeption des Art. 5 Abs. 1 Satz 2 GG als \"dienende Freiheit\" ist Chiffre zur Legitimation eines umfassenden Onlineengagements des öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunks. Diese Konzeption trägt den grundlegenden Änderungen der modernen Informationsgesellschaft, in der Medien-Freiheiten Jedermann-Freiheiten sind, nicht Rechnung. Sie besitzt auch keine Anschlussfähigkeit an die europarechtliche Grundrechtsdogmatik, die \"dienende (Medien- )Freiheiten\" nicht kennt. Erforderlich ist eine (Wieder- )Belebung des individualrechtlichen Kerns der grundrechtlich geschützten Rundfunkfreiheit. Nach Massgabe der gebotenen (Neu- )Konzeption der grundrechtlichen Kommunikationsverfassung ist eine Vollversorgung des öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunks im Internet von Verfassungs wegen unzulässig. Gebührenfinanzierte Onlineangebote des öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunks sind nur zulässig, wenn sie im Vergleich zu den Angeboten Privater einen (quantitativen oder qualitativen) kommunikativen Mehrwert begründen. Darüber hinaus sind besondere Vorkehrungen der Vielfaltsicherung im öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunk notwendig.

This unique Handbook: combines cutting-edge theory with appropriate data and methods; explores the mechanisms of formal and informal social involvement including the role of parental class and cultural influence, and the consequences for our personal and community lives; links social capital with other domains of social inequality such as cultural practice and philanthropic behaviour in an in-depth examination of the social stratification processes; conducts a thorough analysis of formal and informal social involvement, and bonding and bridging social ties on trust, tolerance, community cohesion, educational attainment, labour market position, quality of life and ethnic entrepreneurism; analyses social capital as both an outcome and as a mediating variable at the micro, meso and macro levels. Accessible yet rigorous, this Handbook presents a challenge to both social capital researchers interested in explaining social inequality and to policy-makers with responsibility for designing effective measures for combating social exclusion.

His songs in films like Pyaasa, Naya Daur and Phir Subah Hogi have attained the status of classics.

Due to the great complexity of the scientific fields involved, these questions are framed and answered mostly by scientific experts. But the new technological possibilities and social practices connected with genetic manipulation intrude into domains that for a long time have been the provenance of religious and secular worldviews and touch upon deep-seated convictions and emotions. Moreover they are strongly influenced by economic and political interests. As a consequence, questions of scientific truth and technical control are getting more and more mixed up with questions regarding values and interests. Against this background, this book starts from the premise that neither clinging to the idea of value-neutral, disinterested science, nor the complete abandonment of this idea in favour of postmodern relativism will be of much help here.--","price":51.84,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2020-11-12T06:23:07.461668","updatedAt":"2022-05-26T02:01:06.140356"}

In 2010, China surpassed the United States as Africa's top trading partner; its quest to build a strategic partnership with Africa on own its terms through tied aid, trade, and development finance is also part of Beijing's broader aspirations to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower. Africa and other emerging economies have become attractive partners for China not only for natural resources, but as growing markets. Africa's rapid growth since 2000 has not just occurred because of higher commodity prices, but more importantly due to other factors including improved governance, economic reforms, and an expanding labor force. China's rapid and successful expansion in Africa is due to multiple factors, including economic diplomacy that is clearly superior to that of the United States. China's \"no strings attached\" approach to development, however, risks undoing decades of Western efforts to promote good governance. Consequently, this monograph examines China's oil diplomacy, equity investments in strategic minerals, and food policy toward Africa. The official U.S. rhetoric is that China's rise in Africa should not be seen as a zero-sum game, but areas where real U.S.-China cooperation can help Africa remain elusive, mainly because of Beijing's hyper-mistrust of Washington. The United States could help itself, and Africa, by improving its own economic diplomacy and adequately funding its own soft-power efforts.","price":44.06,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2020-11-12T09:07:39.410799","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T22:12:57.703408"}

Overall, vulnerability assessments provided valuable information on climate change effects and possible management actions but were far from a comprehensive picture for the future of the Southwest.

Commodity driven clearcut regeneration harvests have given way to thinnings intended to enhance development of late-successional forest habitats and to conserve important aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Density Management in the 21st Century: West Side Story presents abstracts and peer reviewed papers from a regional conference highlighting more than twenty years of research related to forest thinning in the NWFP area. Presentations from the BLM Density Management and Riparian Buffer Study provide a focal point, with presentations from additional studies providing for a more complete overview of the west-side thinning science. The contributions are organized as five topical themes: The Regional and Landscape Context for Density Management in the Northwest Forest Plan Era; Implementation and Influences of Density Management in the Terrestrial Ecosystem; Riparian and Aquatic Ecosystems and their Responses to Thinning and Buffers; Socioeconomics and Operations; and Thinning and Adaptation. Collectively, the contributions summarize many important forest dynamics and ecosystem responses to partial overstory removals. Interactions between aquatic and riparian ecosystem conservation measures and upland harvest are emphasized. Targeting resource management practitioners, decision-makers and researchers, the collected works provide a reference to the current and future roles and issues of density management as a tool for forest ecosystem management.","price":51.57,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2020-11-12T12:26:46.747731","updatedAt":"2020-11-12T12:26:46.747731"}

There is clear evidence, however, that when it comes to social entrepreneurship, policy attention has not been matched by growth in scholarly research. This volume illustrates the type of empirical effort that must take place for the field to advance. The authors review the latest research in the field and then address the many challenges - heterogeneous institutions, geographies and cultures, fast evolving practices, the lack of reliable large datasets, and fragmented theory building - that have hampered the development of this research. In many ways, the fundamental questions relating to the rationale and definitions of social entrepreneurship are still very much a work in progress. The main characteristics emerging from the theoretical and empirical discussions in this volume exemplify such complexity. This volume will inspire future researchers to pursue cross-disciplinary theory building, with the aim of building on what we already know and resolving what remains controversial. It will also help researchers think creatively about how their work can inform practice and policy making through the initial design of the research model. This book offers an empirical approach to social entrepreneurship, that researchers, students and policy makers will find invaluable.","price":29.6,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2020-11-12T18:43:36.468690","updatedAt":"2021-12-29T07:30:07.730127"}

But in doing so it has illegally expropriated and demolished hundreds of homes, and forcibly evicted homeowners, violating their rights in the process.  Based on interviews with affected homeowners, 'They Took Everything From Me' documents how the authorities forcibly evicted residents and demolished homes without adequate notice, often without warning or in the middle of the night, and destroyed or damaged personal possessions. In some cases the authorities cut off services, including electricity and water, and dismantled apartment buildings in order to compel remaining residents to leave. The report describes how the government refused to provide homeowners fair compensation for the values of properties, many of which are in highly-desirable locations.  It also details the lack of effective legal recourse or remedy to individuals whose rights were violated.  One of the four neighborhoods described in this report is Bayil, the seaside location of the National Flag Square and the Baku Crystal Hall, the venue for the May 2012 Eurovision Song Contest.  Human Rights Watch calls on the Azerbaijani government to halt all further expropriations, evictions, and demolitions until they can be carried out in a manner consistent with Azerbaijani law and international human rights law. The prosecutor's office should initiate an independent inquiry into why the expropriations and demolitions in central Baku have been allowed to take place in a manner that clearly violates Azerbaijani and international law.\"--P.

In this report, 16 common constraints on project delivery are identified from the literature and case studies. Twenty-four strategies are discussed for addressing or avoiding the constraints. These strategies are grouped into six expediting themes: improve public involvement and support; improve resource agency involvement and collaboration; demonstrate real commitment to the project; improve internal communication and coordination; streamline decision making; and integrate across all phases of project delivery.","price":83.53,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2020-11-13T16:07:42.838326","updatedAt":"2020-11-13T16:07:42.838326"}

However, in esthetically sensitive areas forest managers sometimes use methods that soften the visual impact, such as smaller clearcuts (patch cuts) or low-density shelterwoods. It is unclear if these methods produce the same effects as clearcuts on tree regeneration and breeding bird habitat. A comparison of a 15-acre clearcut, four patch cuts varying in size from 2.9 to 5.5 acres, and a 34-acre low-density shelterwood showed that the patches regenerated some early successional tree species, similar to the clearcut, however, the smaller 3-acre patches also produced a higher component of beech and less pin cherry. The shelterwood produced high proportions of beech and striped maple. Early successional, generalists, and mid-/later successional birds were present in all three treatment areas although the clearcut and patches had higher proportions and more observations of early successional bird species.","price":81.17,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2020-11-14T08:21:32.782683","updatedAt":"2020-11-14T08:21:32.782683"}

Jenkins Hains, is, by way of contrast, to the last an out-and-out story of piracy, and the breezes that blow through its pages are laden, so we are constantly reminded, with the pestilent breath of the slave ship. It is claimed for this book that the descriptions of life on board ship are noteworthy for their realistic strength; and there seems to be no reason for questioning their accuracy. But taken altogether, the brutality of the officers toward their crew, the inhumanity meted out to the living cargo of slaves, the carnage of the encounter with rival pirates, and finally the wholesale massacre when the slaves break loose and run amuck, leave an impression of a needless surfeit of horrors, a sort of piratical Dance of Death. — *The Bookman, Volume XXI, pages 518-9*\r\n\r\n\"Captain Hains, the master of the straight sea story, has built a picture that teems with the sea life of the time, striking in its splendid details.

Making research results freely available online as Open Access is considered to achieve the widest possible dissemination worldwide. Everyone can access anywhere Open Access publications without any restrictions or paywalls. Meanwhile more and more academic institutions and universities have already started their own presses to publish books Open Access. \r\nIn the present manual a sustainable and ideal workflow for producing and publishing academic books is presented. That workflow enables universities to publish their publications both as Open Access and printed books in a state-of-theart way and without any restrictions regarding the license, the variety of formats, print run etc. As proof of concepts we have processed different use cases which demonstrates the current status of the technically and economically possibilities in the publishing sector. Furthermore, data on time, costs and personnel resources were determined, which can be used by other universities and academic institutions to indicate the necessary investments for founding and operation of their own Open Access university presses.\"\n\n\"Die zeitnahe, transparente und nachhaltige Verbreitung nachprüfbarer wissenschaftlicher Ergebnisse ist eine der wesentlichen Anforderungen an die wissenschaftliche Kommunikation und Infrastruktur. Open Access, also die offene und kostenfreie Nutzung von wissenschaftlicher Literatur, ist hierfür die Grundvoraussetzung. Hochschulen und Universitäten sind in der Regel die Institutionen, an denen Wissenschaftler neue Forschungsergebnisse erzeugen und zur Veröffentlichung als Buch vorbereiten.

Work and livelihoods for Indigenous Australians after CDEP","subjects":["Australia","Welfare & benefit systems","Indigenous peoples"],"description":"The end of the very long-standing Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) scheme in 2015 marked a critical juncture in Australian Indigenous policy history. For more than 30 years, CDEP had been among the biggest and most influential programs in the Indigenous affairs portfolio, employing many thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. More recently, it had also become a focus of intense political contestation that culminated in its ultimate demise. This book examines the consequences of its closure for Indigenous people, communities and organisations. The end of CDEP is first situated in its broader historical and political context: the debates over notions of ‘self-determination’ versus ‘mainstreaming’ and the enduring influence of concerns about ‘passive welfare’ and ‘mutual obligation’. In this way, the focus on CDEP highlights more general trends in Indigenous policymaking, and questions whether the dominant government approach is on the right track. Each chapter takes a different disciplinary approach to this question, variously focusing on the consequences of change for community and economic development, individual work habits and employment outcomes, and institutional capacity within the Indigenous sector. Across the case studies examined, the chapters suggest that the end of CDEP has heralded the emergence of a greater reliance on welfare rather than the increased employment outcomes the government had anticipated. Concluding that CDEP was ‘better than welfare’ in many ways, the book offers encouragement to policymakers to ensure that future reforms generate livelihood options for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians that are, in turn, better than CDEP.","price":64.63,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2020-11-16T21:34:00.620241","updatedAt":"2020-11-16T21:34:00.620241"}

The act of copying, and the creation and transaction of rights relating to it, evokes fundamental notions of communication and censorship, of authorship and ownership—of privilege and property. This volume conceives a new history of copyright law that has its roots in a wide range of norms and practices. The essays reach back to the very material world of craftsmanship and mechanical inventions of Renaissance Italy where, in 1469, the German master printer Johannes of Speyer obtained a five-year exclusive privilege to print in Venice and its dominions. Along the intellectual journey that follows, we encounter John Milton who, in 1644 accused the English parliament of having been deceived by the ‘fraud of some old patentees and monopolizers in the trade of bookselling’ (i.e. the London Stationers’ Company). Later revisionary essays investigate the regulation of the printing press in the North American colonies as a provincial and somewhat crude version of European precedents, and how, in the revolutionary France of 1789, the subtle balance that the royal decrees had established between the interests of the author, the bookseller, and the public, was shattered by the abolition of the privilege system. Some of the essays also address the specific evolution of rights associated with the visual and performing arts. The volume is a companion to the digital archive Primary Sources on Copyright (1450-1900), funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). Privilege and Property is recommended in the Times Higher Education Textbook Guide (November, 2010).","price":83.76,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2020-11-16T21:45:19.280450","updatedAt":"2020-11-16T21:45:19.280450"}

Moreover, the political and territorial ambitions entailed by the various ethnic nationalisms often collided with each other. Eventually, as elsewhere, a marriage of necessity brought the two together. Yugoslav communists had to acknowledge that nationalism was a potent political force. They thus continued searching for a political project that could successfully combine both social and national emancipation in the context of developed and often mutually exclusive national projects of neighbouring groups. In this chapter, I show how the Yugoslav communists ‘discovered’ the successful federalist formula for the socialist re unification of Yugoslavia after the Second World War as well as how, as with any ‘successful’ formula, its discovery was preceded by numerous fruitless experiments.","price":63.65,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2020-11-16T21:48:12.986738","updatedAt":"2020-11-16T21:48:12.986738"}

The welfare state, social work, Second World War, closure of the asylums, even the legalization of suicide, are all implicated in the prominence of self harm in Britain. The rise of 'overdosing as a cry for help' is linked to the integration of mental and physical healthcare, the NHS, and the change in the law on suicide and attempted suicide. The shift from overdosing to self-cutting as the most prominent 'self-damaging' behaviour is also explained, linked to changes in hospital organization and the wider rise of neoliberal politics.

When e-Government was first conceived, it was designed upon basic technologies where the emphasis was only on the simple display of government information for citizens to read. Nowadays, e-Government design comprises many complicated modules such as upload and download consoles, two-way interaction consoles between citizens and government agents, integrated government business processes presenting the whole of government, and it does not depend solely on technology. The complexity of e-Government has now evolved to include political, cultural, economic, social and technical dimensions. Bringing all these difficult aspects together is so complicated that it needs carefully planned strategies informed by local contextual characteristics. \r\n\r\nRather than giving formulaic definitions and conceptual standpoints on many aspects of e-Government, as is the case in many e-Government publications, this book will explore the frontiers of global knowledge value chains by discussing current and future dimensions of e-Government. For example, the book discusses the concept of data governance by exploring how actual opening up of government data can be achieved, especially in a developing world context. Further, the book posits that opening government data should be followed by the opening up of government business processes in order to peddle the concept of accountability and responsiveness. Much text on data governance has concentrated on articulating the basic definitions surrounding this concept. Another very important topic explored in this book is regarding how the concept of decolonisation can be extended to e-Government by providing practical examples as to how researchers in the developing world can contribute to the advancement of e-Government as a scientific field of enquiry and guide its implementation, thereof. Decolonisation is advocated for in e-Government research so that there is a balance in the inclusion of the Afrocentric knowledge into e-Government advancement other than over-reliance on the Euro-, Asia- and America-centric knowledge value chains (Mbembe 2015). \r\n\r\nAs e-Government is a very expensive undertaking, the issue of funding has excluded African countries and a majority of the developing world from implementing e-Government. Despite funding being a critical cornerstone of e-Government development, there is a dearth of information on this topic. Therefore, this book provides a chapter which discusses traditional and innovative ways of funding e-Government design and implementation which can go a long way in improving e-Government penetration into the developing world. Further, the book explores how intelligent e-Government applications can be designed, especially in resource-constrained countries. A couple of emerging technology innovations such as fog computing and intelligent information technology are explored within the realm of e-Government design.","price":87.84,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2020-11-16T23:05:06.604804","updatedAt":"2020-11-16T23:05:06.604804"}

Such an approach is necessary, given the sector-based approach and the legislative patchwork adopted by the EU in the field of Immigration Policy. Moreover, EU law on migration is a new but a very dynamic field which is constantly evolving. Therefore, the project not only analyses the key definitions, central themes and legal issues of the Directive but also examines its interaction and tries to establish some connections with the other EU instruments on legal migration into the EU, most of them adopted on the so-called sector-based approach (Single Permit Directive, Family Reunification Directive, Long-term Residents Directive, Researchers, Students and Others Directive, etc.). In particular, the project tries do draw a parallel between some of the Blue Card Directive provisions and the jurisprudence of the European Court delivered for similar notions or legal problems contained in the others instruments. Furthermore, the work addresses other specific issues such us : mobility, the problem of an “ethical recruitment” of highly skilled workers, the volumes of admission (to be set by the Member States), the maintaining of national schemes for highly qualified migrants besides the EU Blue Card and the integration of migrants already admitted in the Member States.\n\nL’auteure analyse le dispositif mis en place par la Directive Carte bleue, non pas en tant que système à part entière, mais comme partie intégrante de la politique européenne en matière d’immigration.

Cette évolution a, entre autres, reçu une nouvelle impulsion avec l’entrée en vigueur du Traité de Lisbonne en 2009 et le passage à la procédure de codécision. Étudier le dispositif de la carte bleue comme une des pièces maîtresses du rouage de la politique européenne en matière de migration légale s’avère nécessaire compte tenu de l’approche sectorielle adoptée par l’UE dans ce domaine et la fragmentation juridique qu’elle occasionne. Dans ce cadre, ce travail s’intéresse non seulement à l’analyse des éléments essentiels et aux problèmes juridiques de la Directive Carte bleue, tels que la mobilité, le problème du recrutement éthique des travailleurs hautement qualifiés, les volumes d’admission, le maintien des systèmes nationaux parallèles pour les travailleurs hautement qualifiés aux côtés du système de la carte bleue ainsi que l’intégration des ressortissants des États tiers déjà admis sur le territoire des États membres, mais examine également les interactions et les liens du système avec d’autres instruments adoptés dans le cadre de la migration légale.

He is among the first who developed a concept of political religion. His 1935 contribution couldn't be published at this time. Today an edition of this contribution is important for theology and church history.

Increasingly public services are provided in digital form; their uptake however remains well below expectations. In particular, amongst older adults the need for public services is high, while at the same time the uptake of digital services is lower than the population average. One of the reasons is that many digital public services (or e-services) do not respond well to the life worlds, use contexts and use practices of its target audiences. This book argues that when older adults are involved in the process of identifying, conceptualising, and designing digital public services, these services become more relevant and meaningful. The book describes and compares three co-creation projects that were conducted in two European cities, Bremen and Zaragoza, as part of a larger EU-funded innovation project. The first part of the book traces the origins of co-creation to three distinct domains, in which co-creation has become an equally important approach with different understandings of what it is and entails: (1) the co-production of public services, (2) the co-design of information systems and (3) the civic use of open data. The second part of the book analyses how decisions about a co-creation project’s governance structure, its scope of action, its choice of methods, its alignment with strategic policies and its embedding in existing public information infrastructures impact on the process and its results. The final part of the book identifies key challenges to co-creation and provides a more general assessment of what co-creation may achieve, where the most promising areas of application may be and where it probably does not match with the contingent requirements of digital public services. Contributing to current discourses on digital citizenship in ageing societies and user-centric design, this book is useful for researchers and practitioners interested in co-creation, public sector innovation, open government, ageing and digital technologies, citizen engagement and civic participation in socio-technical innovation.","price":60.89,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2020-11-17T01:17:38.959748","updatedAt":"2020-11-17T01:17:38.959748"}

Thus, »problematization« is positioned as a critical concept that links, often in intricate ways, several currents from speculative philosophy to the formation of interdisciplinary fields. The »problematic«, as it turns out, has been the source of change in philosophy and the sciences all along.","price":74.58,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2020-11-17T01:18:43.438392","updatedAt":"2020-11-17T01:18:43.438392"}

Para el lector que la aborde, también será difícil sustraerse a la prosa envolvente e hipnótica de su autor. Alejandro Ballesteros, joven profesor de arte, llega en mitad del invierno a Venecia, una ciudad arrasada por la nieve y las inundaciones, dispuesto a completar sus estudios sobre el misterioso cuadro del pintor renacentista Giorgione que da título a esta novela. En apenas cuatro días, Ballesteros es testigo del asesinato de un famoso falsificador de arte, se enamora de una mujer excepcional y conoce a personajes tenebrosos unidos por la clandestinidad del delito. Y todo ello en el marco de una ciudad donde la vida y el arte se confunden y donde nada es lo que parece. La tempestad es una novela de intriga y a la vez una reflexión sobre el arte entendido como religión del sentimiento, una novela sobre el imperio de los sentidos y la condena inaplazable de los recuerdos.","price":29.19,"type":"paperback","createdAt":"2009-12-09T23:30:13.262629","updatedAt":"2020-11-27T02:28:14.881810"}

Access to finance has become an important issue for policymakers in Latin America.  Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), in particular, complain that their lack of access to adequate sources of financing is an obstacle to their growth.  Chile represents an interesting case study since it has one of the most developed financial markets in the continent, and thus great potential for using products suited to the needs and risk characteristics of SMEs.  The author concludes that the largest firms have access to the whole range of financial instruments available in Chile.  All smaller firms face financing constraints.

However, firms that have large, minority shareholders are more likely to adopt these provisions.

The focus of the volume, like that of the Army and civilian artists themselves, is on the composite reality captured in each image and on the interplay between related images. The result is a portrait in its truest sense, a distilling of experience as remembered in telling details. But it is also a collective portrait, a commemoration of all the men and women who have served the Army and their country so well.

If there is a causal \"quantity-quality tradeoff,\" then policies that discourage large families should lead to increased human capital, higher earnings, and, at the macro level, promote economic development. Ordinary least squares regression estimates and a large theoretical literature suggest that this is indeed the case. This paper presents new evidence on the child-quantity/child-quality trade-off. Our empirical strategy exploits exogenous variation in family size due to twin births and preferences for a mixed sibling-sex composition, as well as ethnic differences in the effects of these variables and preferences for male births in some ethnic groups. We use these sources of variation to look at the causal effect of family size on completed educational attainment, fertility, and earnings. For the purposes of this analysis, we constructed a unique matched data set linking Israeli Census data with information on the demographic structure of families drawn from a population registry. Our results show no evidence of a quantity-quality trade-off, though some estimates from one subsample suggest that first-born girls from large families marry sooner\"--Forschungsinstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit web site.","price":21.16,"type":"audio","createdAt":"2020-12-17T02:45:50.624092","updatedAt":"2020-12-17T02:45:50.624092"}

The other is the size of gaps in mean achievement among schools (adjusted for student characteristics). NAEP data is used to demonstrate that in national data, gaps which appear large by one standard may appear small by the other.

Fans loved him; coaches respected him; players joked with him; and league executives applauded him for adding flavor with his trademark \"first dooowwwnnn\" call. Long before he worked three Super Bowls and became the only official ever to be named the All-Madden team, Cashion nearly gave up on his NFL dreams. He began officiating junior high games in 1952 while still a student at Texas A&M, but he was fired by the Southland Conference for being too robotic and dull. Nevertheless, Cashion scheduled a January 1972 trip to New York to meet with Art McNally, the Director of Officiating for the NFL. McNally listened politely and then delicately told Cashion there were no openings. Cashion left that day with a broken heart, believing the dream was officially over. But an NFL official was killed during the summer of '72 and McNally offered Cashion the job because he'd taken such a bold risk by traveling to New York. The rest is NFL history, as Cashion's No. 43 uniform became as familiar to many fans at NFL stadiums as some of the players. Red's feel-good life story packs a powerfully enthusiastic punch.","price":14.33,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2021-01-23T09:54:57.731055","updatedAt":"2021-01-23T09:54:57.731055"}

In the squalor of this hell-hole, his faith is shattered by the cruelty of a sadistic Union Sergeant named Buck Hagan. Consumed with hatred, Pat vows to kill Hagan. Upon his release from the prison camp at the end of the war, Pat trades his Bible for a gun and becomes the town marshal in his home town, Pine Creek, Georgia. Later, due to an extraordinary set of circumstances, Pat is named a Deputy U.S. Marshal. In the chaotic aftermath of the fall of the Confederacy, three killers are terrorizing communities in central Georgia. Pat and two other marshals are ordered to bring the killers to justice. When two of the killers are apprehended, Pat's two associates are assigned to other duties, leaving Pat to track down the leader of the gang alone. As he doggedly follows one lead after another, it becomes evident that the man he is pursuing is none other than Buck Hagan, the man he has threatened to kill. The search for the elusive Hagan is time-consuming and hampered by many dead-end leads. Finally, one lead pays off, and Pat comers Hagan in a farm house near the little town of Abbeville, Georgia. With both barrels of his sawed-off shotgun cocked, Pat enters the house and comes face-to-face with Hagan, only to discover that there is one more trade to be made.","price":7.43,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2021-03-27T22:40:36.517290","updatedAt":"2021-10-08T22:42:49.264574"}

This book provides an introduction to VIVO, http://vivoweb.org/, a tool for representing information about research and researchers--their scholarly works, research interests, and organizational relationships. VIVO provides an expressive ontology, tools for managing the ontology, and a platform for using the ontology to create and manage linked open data for scholarship and discovery. Begun as a project at Cornell and further developed by an NIH funded consortium, VIVO is now being established as an open-source project with community participation from around the world. By the end of 2012, over 20 countries and 50 organizations will provide information in VIVO format on more than one million researchers and research staff, including publications, research resources, events, funding, courses taught, and other scholarly activity.

Within days the barbed-wire entanglement would undergo an extraordinary metamorphosis: it became an imposing 103-mile-long wall guarded by three hundred watchtowers. A physical manifestation of the struggle between Soviet Communism and American capitalism—totalitarianism and freedom—that would stand for nearly thirty years, the Berlin Wall was the high-risk fault line between East and West on which rested the fate of all humanity. Many brave people risked their lives to overcome this lethal barrier, and some paid the ultimate price.In this captivating work, sure to be the definitive history on the subject, Frederick Taylor weaves together official history, archival materials and personal accounts to tell the complete story of the Wall's rise and fall, from the postwar political tensions that created a divided Berlin to the internal and external pressures that led to the Wall's demise. In addition, he explores the geopolitical ramifications as well as the impact the wall had on ordinary lives that is still felt today. For the first time the entire world faced the threat of imminent nuclear apocalypse, a fear that would be eased only when the very people the Wall had been built to imprison breached it on the historic night of November 9, 1989.Gripping and authoritative, The Berlin Wall is the first comprehensive account of a divided city and its people in a time when the world seemed to stand permanently on the edge of destruction.","price":79.17,"type":"hardcover","createdAt":"2009-10-23T22:20:18.473231","updatedAt":"2021-12-27T11:49:13.540428"}

For a while, Andy hit rock bottom – he drank too much, was abandoned by his friends, nearly lost his business and became a pariah in the place he had once called home.\r\n\r\nNow, six years later, Andy has put his life back together. He’s sold the house he shared with Brie and moved away for a fresh start. When he hears his old house has been bulldozed and a new house built in its place, he’s not bothered. He’s settled with a new partner, Jayne, and life is good.\r\n\r\nBut Andy’s peaceful world is about to shatter. One day, a woman shows up at his old address, screaming, ‘Where’s my house?

The police are notified and old questions – and dark suspicions – resurface.\r\n\r\nCould Brie really be alive after all these years? If so, where has she been?

Chaque titre recourt ainsi à une trame voisinant plus ou moins la fiction afin d'illustrer le cheminement d'un philosophe ayant marqué son époque. Dans cet opus: à la veille du discours qu'il doit prononcer devant les professeurs de la Sorbonne, qui décideront si on lui accorde ou non le titre de maître, Érasme voit surgir devant lui une femme vêtue d'un costume de bouffon orné de grelots. Se faisant appeler Marotte, sa visiteuse affirme: \"Avant de philosopher, il faut vivre! Avant d'être sage, il faut être fou. Avant de penser, il faut se dépenser\" (p. 22). Et la voilà qui l'entraîne dans un voyage nocturne sur un tapis volant, direction le désert. En lui racontant notamment l'histoire de la tour de Babel, son interlocutrice démontre au philosophe que la folie régit le monde en prenant différentes formes: l'avarice, la cupidité, la colère, la gourmandise, etc. Ayant réalisé que \"l'histoire des hommes est l'histoire de leurs guerres\" (p. 38), Érasme décide de faire non pas l'éloge de la philosophie et de la sagesse comme il le projetait, mais bien celui de la folie afin d'offrir aux hommes un miroir reflétant véritablement ce qu'ils sont. Ceci tout en étant conscient que \"le plus fou [est] celui qui se croit sage\" (p. 62) ... [SDM].\n\nUn ouvrage de gai savoir porté par un texte pimpant, festival de jeux de mots et de bonne humeur qui sied parfaitement aux fondements de la pensée du philosophe, qui est exposée de manière plutôt limpide. L'album s'inscrit cependant dans une collection quelque peu mal ciblée, la facture des ouvrages risquant de rebuter les élèves du secondaire tandis que les concepts abordés dans le texte sont très complexes pour les plus jeunes. Un outil que l'on réservera dans le cadre d'animations, d'ateliers ou de débats effectués en classe sous la gouverne d'un mentor à même d'apporter les éclaircissements nécessaires à une bonne compréhension et à l'assimilation de la théorie. Des collages stylisés aux couleurs toniques illustrent le tout dans un débordement de fantaisie en campant les protagonistes vêtus de culottes bouffantes à la manière des fous du roi dans un décor moyenâgeux empreint d'une atmosphère de carnaval.
